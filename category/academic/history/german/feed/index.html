										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not quite the same feeling and fun as a road trip, but fun enough.<br />
Yeah, archive work! Yeah, Germany! Yeah, yeah archive work in Germany! So I just spent the last two weeks in Germany (by myself, not so yeah) doing some archival research for the dissertation. Here are some thoughts on the trip.</p>
<h3>1. Internet!</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1368" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1368 " title="IMG_0141" alt="Starbucks" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-1024x682.jpg 1024w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-250x166.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-150x100.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-624x416.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141.jpg 1620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1368" class="wp-caption-text">The Starbucks with Internet&#8230; saved my bacon.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Make sure you have a good internet connection where you will stay. I booked a decent hotel with Internet included, and free breakfast. The only problem is, the connection to the Internet is spotty at best. I have to get a new user/pass combination to connect to the Internet every 24 hours, too. It&#8217;s so frustrating to want to communicate, but not be able to. Especially when you&#8217;re trying to get in touch with family back home. So, do some research and hope you get lucky. Also, it is important to know any quirks about the Internet in the country you go to, if going out side of the USA. In Germany, they use 13 channels for their routers, in the USA we only use 11. So if your place of stay uses channel 12 or 13, you&#8217;re almost out of luck. You can pick up a relatively cheap USB wireless adapter in the country that should get you all of their available channels. But you will most likely have to find some place with Internet to download software. Enter in the great Internet hubs scattered throughout the world: Starbucks and McDonalds! Even BurgerKing has Internet available. Find out where they are and use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. This is only a test.</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1372" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1372" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1372 " title="IMG_0209" alt="weinachtsmarkt" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-1024x682.jpg 1024w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-250x166.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-150x100.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-624x416.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209.jpg 1620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1372" class="wp-caption-text">Getting ready for Christmas!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Don&#8217;t get your hopes up too high for your first trip. I kind of went on this trip with the attitude that it would be a test run of a later real trip. This was possible because I know that I&#8217;m coming back in a few months. If you don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ll ever go back, then you need to do a lot of background research and contacting before hand. I had scheduled to go to the archive Tuesday through Friday the first week and Monday through Thursday the second week. The first day ended up being a get settled day; exchanging money, finding my way around, finding the Starbucks for Internet, etc. It often felt like I was wasting time, but if you know you are going to go back, then it is time well spent to get your bearings and figure things out. I lived in Germany for two years, but that was a life time ago (like 15 years ago). So I am a bit rusty on speaking German, and German customs, and such. Luckily that mostly all came back easily.</p>

<h3>3. Talk to me.</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1369" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1369" title="IMG_0193" alt="Divided" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-200x300.jpg 200w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-682x1024.jpg 682w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-250x375.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-100x150.jpg 100w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-624x936.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1369" class="wp-caption-text">A house divided&#8230; will make a good restaurant.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Talk with your contacts before leaving home. Or email them. Let them know exactly what you want to do, what you want to research, where you are going to look, etc. They can save you lots of time. I had one contact at the University of Freiburg, Professor Ulricht Herbert. I met with him twice, and he gave me sound advice. I should have emailed him more often before hand, but nothing really beats face to face contact anyway. My one contact here has turned into two or three. He also helped me realize I am trying to do too much in my dissertation. As it stands, its really a life&#8217;s work project. Going through the sources helped me understand that too. There is just way too much for me to be able to grasp it in two years time (my goal). Instead, I&#8217;m going to scale back and only cover one tunnel project, and cover that in depth. The reason there is no all encompassing history about the underground projects from World War II is because it was a huge project. Basically the whole of the German economy was turned to focus on these projects towards the end of the War. There is just too much to understand, too many documents to go through, and too much to grasp before this history can be written. That&#8217;s why nobody has done it, yet. It would take lots of financing and lots of time. Dr. Herbert suggested four years of work, but only after I had perfect understanding of German, have read all that has been written on the subject so far, and had an intimate grasp of Germany in World War II. That ain&#8217;t gonna happen in two years when I have a full-time job, a family, and no financial support. Perhaps that will be my ongoing project as a professor&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. I&#8217;ll make a note of that&#8230;</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1373" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1373" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1373" title="IMG_0211" alt="Schemmer" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-200x300.jpg 200w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-682x1024.jpg 682w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-250x375.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-100x150.jpg 100w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-624x936.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1373" class="wp-caption-text">Hotel Schemmer. Home away from home.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure out a good note taking routine. I have several hundred documents digitized from another archive already, and figured out a good naming scheme for them. I have a spread sheet for taking notes on each file, and for later import into Omeka for an online archive. This time around was a little different. The Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv in Freiburg had lots of documents for me to go through. Whereas before it was one collection/folder in one archive, I now had many collections/folders in one archive. So I had to figure out something a little different. I also didn&#8217;t have enough money to make digital copies of any of the records I found. It turned out that I didn&#8217;t need to make any, but that should be budgeted and planned for as well. There were a handful of documents that I wanted copies of, so I just transcribed them into a word processing document. I thought about making them plain text documents, but ran into a few formatting issues. I chose to make them LibreOffice (OpenOffice) Text documents, because there will always be a program that can open those, and that program is free. Of course, any program nowadays can open Microsoft Word documents, too, and there is no fancy formatting, so that would work fine too. One of my greatest struggles so far is keeping the documents in place chronologically. So my naming scheme for the files takes care of that. Start the name of the file with the year, then month number, then day number (YYYY-MM-DD), and the documents sort themselves! The file viewer (File Explorer for Windows or Finder for Macs) will usually sort by alphabet, so there&#8217;s nothing to it. Another thing I did was to go through the documents as quickly as I could. If It looked like it was helpful, I jotted notes about it, or quickly transcribed it. I will be able to go through the notes and transcriptions later to make sense out of them. That leads into the next point.</p>

<h3>5. Plan it right.</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1370" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1370" title="IMG_0197" alt="Trolly" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-1024x682.jpg 1024w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-250x166.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-150x100.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-624x416.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197.jpg 1620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1370" class="wp-caption-text">Trolly going through the tunnel.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Leave a day on either end for miscellaneous things. I unintentionally had a whole day with nothing to do. I was finished with the archives on Wednesday, and didn&#8217;t need to leave until Friday. That left me with the whole day on Thursday to tie things up and get ready to leave. I did some laundry, packed my bags and wrote this. It&#8217;s also a good time to go through the notes to make sure you don&#8217;t forget anything.</p>
<h3>6. Enjoy!</h3>
<p>The final tip is to just enjoy the time. If you&#8217;re in a foreign country, take a day to go see the sights. I had a weekend where the archive was not even open, so I spent the day walking around the awesome Altstadt (the oldest part of town, buildings from the 1400&#8217;s!). If you have funding for your trip, just think, who else gets paid to go look at old documents. Man, history is great! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an essay I wrote for a Directed Readings course in Fall 2009, with Marion Deshmukh.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Sonderweg</em> of German History</strong></p>
<p>Before 1940s there was a positive <em>Sonderweg</em> thesis that promoted favorably the differences of Germany from other Western nations.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> This is similar to what every nation does, showing their best side, why they are better or, in a good sense, different than other nations.  These are typical self-promotion tactics that help one feel good with ones’ self, and to help others see the virtues they would like them to see.  This thesis is more appropriately termed the &#8220;German divergence from the West&#8221; in English.  <em>Sonderweg</em> was mainly a derogatory term used by its critics.</p>
<p>After 1940, the positive <em>Sonderweg</em> was no longer developed or used.  A critical <em>Sonderweg</em> took the place of the positive reflection of German history, with the new one attempting to answer one prominent question; How did Germany produce a society and political atmosphere where National Socialism could come to power?  Proponents of this <em>Sonderweg</em> thesis have been Ernst Fraenkel, Hans Rosenberg, George Mosse, Fritz Stern, Karl-Dietrich Bracher, Gerhard A.  Ritter, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Heinrich August Winkler, Helmut Plessner, Leonard Krieger, Kurt Sontheimer, John Maynard Keynes, Fritz Fischer, Wolfgang Mommsen.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Those who argued for a critical <em>Sonderweg</em> put forth the following points for seeing Germany’s special path to National Socialism.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sonderweg</em> proponents were cautious about asserting a &#8220;necessary relationship between long-term developments in German History and the triumph of National Socialism,” but in the end were specifically looking for peculiarities in German politics that hindered a liberal democracy from developing.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></li>
<li>Germany had a relatively late attempt at creating a nation state.  France and the United States of America formed, or attempted to form, a nation in the late eighteenth century.  It was nearly one hundred years, finally in 1871, that Germany was able to form a federal government.</li>
<li><em>Sonderweg</em> proponents hearken back to the <em>Kaiserreich</em> government’s oppressive practices that limited parliament and caused what parties that did form to be rigid and fragmented.</li>
<li>German defeat in World War I is seen as an important part of the German <em>Sonderweg</em>.  The devastating defeat in the First World War left German confidence in tatters.  Coupled with the limiting and demeaning restrictions of the Versailles Treaty, Germany seemed anxious to prove to themselves and Europeans that they were a nation of worth.  The defeat also led Germany into a new phase of government different, full parliamentary constitution with no monarchy or empire.</li>
<li>Germany&#8217;s political culture tended to be conservative.  This made it difficult for liberal parties to be effective.</li>
<li>The &#8220;Junkers-the large agrarian landowners east of the Elbe River&#8221; (similar to the English gentry) retained much of their power.  Whereas other nations had developed a parliament with representative leaders, much of Germany’s power still lay with landed aristocrats.</li>
<li>Bismarck&#8217;s forming the nation-state with &#8220;Blut und Eisen&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;blood and iron&#8221; which put emphasis on the military, and left them unchecked by parliament.  This gave a militaristic approach to German government that lasted through the Weimar Republic and into National Socialism.</li>
<li>The unbourgeois-ness of the bourgeoisie.  They never really revolted against the aristocratic society and political culture.  There was no middle class of people to rise up in rebellion as there were in other Western states.  As a result Germany was left without a tradition of successful revolutions and a history of top-down reforms.  Combined with pressure from the peasants, the middle classes were politically weak.</li>
<li>Germany experienced a strange mixture of social and economic modernization and industrialization and capitalism on one hand, but maintained the old power relations, pre-industrial institutions, and cultures.  It was an odd combination of old powers, cultures and organizations in charge of new social and economic conditions and ways of production.</li>
<li>All of these &#8220;long-term patterns&#8221; came to a head with the &#8220;short-term factors&#8221; of 1920s and 1930s, and help to explain the collapse of the Weimar Republic and rise of National Socialism.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;In a nutshell, the critical <em>Sonderweg</em> thesis claimed to indentify long-term structures and processes that, under the influence of numerous other factors (from the consequences of defeat in World War I through the class conflicts of the 1920s to the peculiarities of Adolf Hitler&#8217;s personality), contributed to the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the triumph of National Socialism&#8221;.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Historians opposed or critical of the <em>Sonderweg</em> have based their critiques partly on methodology.  Opponents to the <em>Sonderweg</em> thesis have been Thomas Nipperdey, David Blackbourn, Geoff Eley, Ernst Nolte, Jürgen Kocka, François Furet,Friedrich Meinecke.</p>
<p>Their opposition consists of the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are several historical continuities to be seen in German history.  For example the <em>Kaiserreich</em> is also a prehistory of the Federal Republic of Germany.  This line of reasoning suggests that as National Socialism fades farther into the past, it becomes less of a clear case that the collapse of the Weimar Republic led to National Socialism.  Supporting a <em>Sonderweg</em> assumes there is a &#8220;normal path&#8221; that Germany could have taken.  To define what a &#8220;normal&#8221; path is, is much to subjective a &#8220;value judgment,&#8221; and the belief in the superiority of &#8220;the West&#8221;.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></li>
<li>A research in Bielefeld has shown that the aristocratic influence (or dominance) over the middle class was no greater in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Germany than in other western European nations.  International comparisons have shown, contrary to <em>Sonderweg</em> hypothesis, that the educated German middle class was &#8220;strong and clearly contoured&#8221;.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> It was a widespread European trait for the bourgeois to turn from liberalism in nineteenth century.</li>
<li>The <em>Kaiserreich</em> did show signs of modernism.  It was &#8220;full of modern dynamism, for example in the areas of science and scholarship, art and culture&#8221;.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></li>
<li>Intensive recent research seems to point to National Socialism as a modern phenomenon, rather than the results of past traditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some core aspects of the <em>Sonderweg</em> have been supported, though, through recent research in three ways:</p>
<p>1.     Three of the basic developmental problems of modern societies showed themselves at the same time only in Germany.  1) Formation of the nation-state, 2) decision to have a constitution (parliament) or no, 3) issues with society brought by industrialization.  Other countries dealt with these individually, that is, with generations, or at least decades, of time in between to iron out difficulties.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>2.     While issues with the middle class, the bourgeoisie, cannot be discounted, they did have less of an effect on Germany society than in other European countries.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>3.     Germany had a &#8220;bureaucratic tradition&#8221; of a strong authoritarian state.  Such power in the hands of the state blocked parliament from functioning, provided effective services to the people, and weakened middle class liberalism.  When a democratic government finally did have power, after World War I in the form of the Weimar Republic, the inability of the leaders to provide a stable economy and society meant Germans were eager, or at least willing, to go back to a strong authoritarian state.  Important to realize, though, is that the rise of National Socialism should be seen separate from the fall of the Weimar Republic.  National Socialism was too new to have broken apart the Weimar Republic; it merely picked up the pieces.</p>
<p>With the Federal Republic the <em>Sonderweg</em> ended for West Germany.  It became a &#8220;normal&#8221; western nation.  East Germany, continued the <em>Sonderweg</em>, much altered of course, until its collapse in 1989-90.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not that I really have time to blog as I do it, but&#8230; I feel like I need to do something historical here&#8230; So why not.</p>
<figure id="attachment_358" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-358" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-358" title="Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-358" class="wp-caption-text">Tunnel at Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (German: Markirch), in Alsace, France</figcaption></figure>
<p>So this is my last class before embarking on my dissertation. The Graduate Research Seminar should hopefully tie up any loose knots in our historical writing abilities. It&#8217;s a course on honing our skills. The syllabus looks great, and I&#8217;m excited for the class. One initial question I had was, why are we learning how to write like historians until the very end? Why don&#8217;t we learn how to write at the beginning or even in the middle? Well, there is a course or two on that, but nothing like this one proposes to be. We&#8217;re apparently going to learn all the behind-the-scene techniques and tricks to the trade. I&#8217;m actually really excited for it. Our Professor is great.</p>
<p>So for this class we&#8217;re supposed to write a 25-30 page paper that will hopefully become a chapter (or at least a bulk of one) of the dissertation. If nothing else, it can be a publishable paper. On the very low end, it will at least teach us something we don&#8217;t want to do for a dissertation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_357" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-357" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-357" title="Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-357" class="wp-caption-text">Map of tunnel locations</figcaption></figure>
<p>My dissertation, as it stands now, is on Nazi Tunnels. The Nazis, towards the middle of the war, decided that they needed to move much of their war manufacturing underground. So they designed and built huge underground bunkers and tunnel systems for factories and depots. Go ahead, google it. There&#8217;s not much out there. Add the keywords, &#8216;melk ebensee&#8217; and you&#8217;ll get a few more responses. The only scholarly works that I know of on this topic are two German books. One is an excellent work by Hans Walter Wichert, <em>Decknamenverzeichnis deutscher unterirdischer Bauten</em>(at <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Decknamenverzeichnis-deutscher-unterirdischer-zweiten-Weltkrieges/dp/3980327140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264723732&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon</a>, already have one), which lists practically all of the underground building sites during Nazi Germany. The second work is a dissertation by Bertrand Perz, <em>Projekt Quarz: Steyr-Daimler-Puch Und Das Konzentrationslager Melk, Industrie, Zwangsarbeit und Konzentrationslager in O?sterreich</em> (<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Das-Konzentrationslager-Melk-Steyr-Daimler-Puch-Projekt/dp/3706541858/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264723686&amp;sr=8-1">at Amazon</a> if anyone wants to buy it for me), which is an in-depth look at one of these underground projects in Melk, Australia.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there are totally no sources available, to my knowledge, that I can use for the current project. That&#8217;s part of my dissertation work, is to dig up all of those sources. It should be fun. It&#8217;s also not manageable in a semester&#8217;s time. So for this semester&#8217;s project I had several ideas.</p>
<figure id="attachment_359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-359 " title="ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359" class="wp-caption-text">Projekt Quarz</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, I thought about doing a micro-study on just one of the tunnels. Unfortunately, in the two or three hours of looking for sources, I couldn&#8217;t find any. I haven&#8217;t checked with the library, yet, but I&#8217;m not hopeful. So my second idea is to look at a more broad topic that touches the issue of the tunnels. One obvious one is, why did they build them in the first place (the answer is to protect them from Allied bombings). But a deeper question begs, why did they think they could do that in the first place. It was a huge undertaking to move so many factories underground. They must have though they could do it. So a deeper question would be, why did the Nazi&#8217;s think they could undertake such a big job. Now let&#8217;s step back a bit, say, 30-50 years, and apply this question to Germany as a whole in the form of, what did German&#8217;s think of their technical and scientific abilities? So that will be my basis of inquiry for this semester&#8217;s project. I will look at what German citizens, German scientists, and German politicians thought about German science and technology from 1900 until the end of World War II. I post more on this as I think it through and find sources.</p>
<p>So, basically, I&#8217;m hoping to keep up the blog as I write the paper and take the class. I&#8217;ll post the methodology that I learn, and the troubles and trials, the triumphs and tackles about writing a historical paper.</p>
<p>First off, I feel completely unprepared because I have no sources. That&#8217;s the first thing to tackle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nazi history is always a good way to sell news, and get people to read.</p>
<p>A few Nazi related items came up in the news lately.</p>
<figure id="attachment_212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-212" title="Hitler" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png" alt="" width="202" height="103" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png 202w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1-150x76.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Never before seen photo of Hitler</figcaption></figure>
<p>From the <a title="Telegraph.co.uk" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/5451531/Unseen-Adolf-Hitler-photographs-published.html" target="_blank">Telegraph.co.uk</a> we have some never before seen photographs of Hitler. From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The colour pictures come from the collection of Hugo Jaeger, Hitler&#8217;s personal photographer, who captured him on camera him from 1936 to the final days of his rule in 1945.</p>
<p>They include a glimpse inside Berghof, his mountaintop estate in Bavaria, and his private apartments in Berlin.&#8221;</p>
<p>This will shed some more light on Hitler and life of top Nazis. It goes well with a find from a fellow PhD student at GMU who found similar photos at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum (<a title="USHMM " href="http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ssalbum/" target="_blank">http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ssalbum/</a>). The photos are of Hitler&#8217;s apartment at Berghof, Hitler mingling with the people and at parades, and other rooms and belongings of Hitler&#8217;s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-213" title="German E-boat" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-300x107.png" alt="" width="300" height="107" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-300x107.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-250x89.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-150x53.png 150w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png 412w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-213" class="wp-caption-text">WWII German E-boat</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also <a title="German E-boat" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30977019/" target="_blank">in the news</a> is a recently uncovered German E-Boat, the S130, which interrupted an allied D-Day training and killed over 700 American servicemen. It is being reconstructed and will be used as a memorial of those who fought in World War II. From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;As owner the world&#8217;s largest privately held collection of military vehicles, Wheatcroft said he envisions the restored vessel as being a &#8220;living memorial to all sailors who died during World War Two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only example of its type left in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want it to become like something brought back from the past.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-214" title="Horton 2-29" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png" alt="" width="409" height="195" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png 409w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-300x143.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-250x119.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-214" class="wp-caption-text">Reconstructed Horton 2-29</figcaption></figure>
<p>And, finally, another World War II vessel <a title="Horton 2-29" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090625-hitlers-stealth-fighter-plane.html" target="_blank">making the news is the Horten 2-29</a>. This was a stealth jet developed by a couple of brothers. It has the uncanny resemblance to our B-2 stealth bomber. Here is <a title="Horton 2-29" href="http://resound1.com/nazi-stealth-jet-could-have-won-war-for-hitler/" target="_blank">a site</a> with a number of cool pictures. National Geographic has a cool documentary about a team of engineers at Northrop Grumman who reconstructed the airplane to test it&#8217;s stealth abilities. Most amazing of all, I think, is that the plane was made from wood! That and several layers of paint, aparently, are what make it nearly invisible to radar. I&#8217;ll have to do some research into this machine and write up a history of it.</p>
