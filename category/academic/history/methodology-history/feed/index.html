<p>I still believe the &#8220;learning pyramid&#8221; has merit despite it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/myths.htm">obvious</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/03/06/why-the-learning-pyramid-is-wrong/">over-generalizations</a> and <a href="http://www.willatworklearning.com/2006/05/people_remember.html">fabricated percentages</a>. Lecturing has it&#8217;s place, but not in my class room.

<p>So, I got to thinking, what format do I want to use for my Monday-Wednesday-Friday, History 100 Western Civilization class? I landed on a discussion based lecture format for Monday and Wednesday, and what I&#8217;m calling a History Lab for Friday. The sciences have this same format. Lecture on two days a week, then go to a lab where you practice what was preached. I figured we could do the same thing with critical thinking skills taught by the humanities. Monday and Wednesday will be a bit of me talking about the time period, with a healthy dose of questions and comments from the students based on the reading they have done. Then on Friday we have a History Lab where we critically examine a primary document from the time period we are learning about. I&#8217;m open to other ideas on what to do during the History Lab. I&#8217;m excited to see if any students offer suggestions.</p>

<p>Today was our first History Lab, and it went very well, I think. I will get the students opinion on Monday, to make this exercise an all around learning experience. For today&#8217;s History Lab I divided the students into groups of five (any more than that gets a bit unmanageable). They each picked a popsicle stick I had in a cup at the front of the desk. There were five popsicle sticks with the same color, but a different &#8220;filter&#8221; written on each of the five sticks. The filters are the biases, or lenses through which to look at history. They included race, gender, science/technology, social class, art, religion, and politics/government. After the students organize into groups, I give them a primary source document to read together, then discuss the document based on the filter that they have. After enough time to allow individual groups to discuss, we discuss altogether as a class. To track participation, attendance and provide accountability, each group had to write a summary of their discussion on the back of the paper, including their names and which filter they had, to be turned in at the end of class.</p>
<p>This seemed to work out pretty well, and the students had great comments. We looked at &#8220;The Spartan Creed&#8221;, a poem written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrtaeus">Tyrtaeus</a> in the 7th Century B.C. (unfortunately no reliable source found, just this post in a <a href="http://www.grtbooks.com/exitfram.asp?idx=3&amp;yr=-5000&amp;aa=AA&amp;at=AA&amp;ref=tyrtaeus&amp;URL=http://www.armageddononline.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-11557.html">forum</a>). The most noticeable thing about this document is how heavily male centric it is. Granted, it&#8217;s a man writing about war, but there is absolutely no mention of a female. It can be implied by the use of the word &#8220;children&#8221;, but no fighting for the protection of wife and family, just city and children. Here are some of the comments the students made on their papers for a few of the filters.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1561" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1561" alt="2013-09-06 10.23.17" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-225x300.jpg 225w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-250x333.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-112x150.jpg 112w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-624x832.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1561" class="wp-caption-text">Directions are an absolute necessity for group work to function well.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gender: Men are dominant, only men are warriors. No reference to women. The society was very male dominated. Women had no role in the Spartan military, so the code is less relevant to them. Females are not even mentioned in the creed, so men are obviously the dominant gender. Among the men, they are expected to be strong, courageous, honorable, every trait that makes them a mighty soldier, a protector of their city-state.</p>
<p>Art: War is their art, the structure of their army, how they fought, etc. It doesn&#8217;t specifically say anything about art, but the way this is written is a form of art and the way the author makes out a man to be is like a piece of art.</p>
<p>Religion: War was treated as a religion. Soldiers were treated as gods when they returned. In death, a Spartan man becomes immortal as his memory is honored as if he is a god. To understand this one must know that in his life he was worshiped for being a good fighter and so that is carried over in a glorious death. Religion and personal values seem to all be related to war; gods are mentioned but the creed is centered around the personal honor of a warrior.</p>
<p>I was pleased with the results. All of the students were engaged in the group work and came up with something intelligent to write about. The beauty of this model is that each student has a focused purpose to look at a historical document, and then is held accountable for sharing something.</p>
<p>Do you have ideas for what we can do in our History Lab? Leave a comment below, and I&#8217;ll give it a try!</p>

<h3>Like a block of stone</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 3. 2007: THE STONE IS WAITING by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/502043040/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/222/502043040_2be8463d8a_m.jpg" alt="MAY 3. 2007: THE STONE IS WAITING" width="240" height="194" /></a></p>
<p>I recently finished writing and rewriting and writing again the essays for several scholarship applications. It is probably a good thing, but that was the most time and effort I have ever spent writing three pages of text. I went through several revisions of each essay, had the wonderful Fulbright advisers at George Mason read and reread the essays, and even went to the vastly underused (by me anyways) campus writing center.</p>
<h3>Roughing it out</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 16. 2007 : DAY 14 by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/507181344/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/193/507181344_572d027046_m.jpg" alt="MAY 16. 2007 : DAY 14" width="240" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>My personal essay started out as being a little too personal, as in informal. At the writing center, I also realized that the opening paragraph was too negative. I wanted to show how as a child I deeply disliked school. In first and second grades, in order to avoid going to school I would often hide in the backyard or somewhere in the house, and generally make a big stink every morning. One time my mom drove me to school (two blocks away) and when we got there I jumped out of the car and ran off into the neighborhood for an hour or so. The rest of elementary school through high school was better; I did not put up as much of a stink, but I still did not like school. I was convinced that I would never have anything to do with school again once I graduated from high school. That&#8217;s how my essay started out, a general idea of what I wanted to write about. Like a big block of stone that I hacked away at.</p>
<h3>Adding Detail</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 22. 2007: DAY 20 by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/513546327/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/204/513546327_53d439b732_m.jpg" alt="MAY 22. 2007: DAY 20" width="177" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to convey all of that in a couple of sentences, all to point to the irony that I am now pursuing the highest degree one can attain in school, and that I am still in school 16 years later, with another three years to go (I did have three years off in there, though). But the gal at the writing center was right. It was a bit too negative. Instead I focused on my strengths as an historian and my technical skills. This worked out much better, since this is one of the major focuses of the dissertation. Through this constant revision and insight from others my project started to take shape.</p>
<h3>Finishing<br />
<a title="FINISHED AND ON ITS PLACE by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/1754287634/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2130/1754287634_b87cc656b6_m.jpg" alt="FINISHED AND ON ITS PLACE" width="179" height="240" /></a></h3>
<p>One of the other really neat things about spending so much effort on an essay (especially one about my dissertation research) is that I was really able to focus my arguments and tighten up my thoughts on what I hope to accomplish.Â Through this process of constant revision I realized three things that I wanted to focus on in my dissertation: the story of the underground dispersal projects; how the projects are memorialized or not, and what that says about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VergangenheitsbewÃ¤ltigung">VergangenheitsbewÃ¤ltigung</a>; and an argument for the change in what is considered scholarship in the historical profession. Going through the constant revisions has changed my focus in some small ways from my original proposal in the dissertation prospectus, but that is to be expected. I feel that I now have a much more polished and obtainable goal.</p>

<p>I spent the day researching grants and reading about how to properly  put together a proposal. I also spent a bit of time plotting out my todo  list for this semester, creating a checklist of tasks and when they are  due. I made the list in my Google Calendar, so it&#8217;s not available to be  embedded on this site. I&#8217;ll have to work on finding a replacement or  something.</p>
<p>One of the places I&#8217;ll be applying to for a research grant is the Social Science Research Council (<a title="SSRC" href="http://www.ssrc.org" target="_blank">http://www.ssrc.org</a>).  They happen to have a short paper on how to best write a proposal for  their competitions, and being no dummy, I know I can apply these tips to  all the proposals I write. So here are some tips from their paper, &#8220;<a title="SSRC - Art of Writing Proposals" href="http://www.ssrc.org/publications/view/7A9CB4F4-815F-DE11-BD80-001CC477EC70/" target="_blank">On the Art of Writing Proposals</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Purpose of Proposals is to Persuade</h4>
<p>The main thing to realize when writing a proposal, is that you are  trying to persuade the approval committee that your project is better  than all the others. The trick is to do it in as short a space as  possible&amp;mdash;in the first paragraph, or at least the first  page&amp;mdash;while including all of the points the readers are looking  for. In the end you want the readers to associate you with your project  (Billy&#8217;s the guy researching blind Algerian water cave fish with  telepathic properties), rather than other mundane tidbits (Jane is the  gal from New York City, right?). It truly is an art.</p>
<h4>What do they want?!</h4>
<p>All scholarly projects require three basic merits: &#8220;conceptual  innovation, methodological rigor, and rich, substantive content.&#8221;  Additionally, the readers are going to be asking three questions that  the proposal needs to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we going to learn?</li>
<li>Why do we need to know?</li>
<li>How do you prove it?</li>
</ul>
<p>And this all needs to be done initially very clearly, succinctly, and as forcefully as possible in the shortest amount of text.</p>
<h4>Let me be clear about this&#8230;</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that the individuals in the approval  committee come from varying disciplines. Therefore, the proposal needs  to be clear, free of the jargon typical of your discipline, all the  while explaining the boundary pushing or unique way your project  approaches your field. Keep the focus of the proposal on the ideas and  leave the technical aspects to an appendix. Make the first page explain  as clearly as possible what the topic is about, and what the  readers&amp;mdash;essentially, what the granting committee&amp;mdash;is  going to learn from this.</p>
<h4>So What!</h4>
<p>This is the crux of  the whole matter. Why in the world does anybody need to know about this?  What&#8217;s the point? Who cares? Why?! This is sometimes the hardest part  to figure out. I know it is for me. I continually mull this point over.  Do I really have a convincing and compelling reason. It seems for the  time being, for me, that my biggest compelling reason, my &#8220;so what?&#8221; is  because it hasn&#8217;t been researched before. While that may be a valid  reason, be careful. Others may conclude that there is adequate  justification for there to be no scholarship in the first place. There  are other aspects that make a research topic important and valid.  &#8220;Turning points, crucial breakthroughs, central personages, fundamental  institutions, and similar appeals to significance of of the object of  research are sometimes effective, if argued rather than merely asserted.</p>
<p>Apply  the topic to current political, economic or social debates. How is your  research not only timely but currently urgent, such that it provides a  new way to view current issues, or turn the direction of current  understanding?</p>
<p>Also try to be fresh and appealing in your  approach. Promote the apparent contradictions, extrapolate on puzzles,  and catch the readers off guard with surprises. Take the less traveled  path. If current trends lean towards one area of research, but your  topic can gyrate towards a new and fresh approach, take it!</p>
<p>Oh Yeah? Prove it!</p>
<p>It  is important for the proposal committee to know the methodology of your  approach. Do not just tell them what you will discover, but how you  intend to discover it. What types of sources, what means of debate, what  technology will be employed? But don&#8217;t just list out your tasks and how  you&#8217;ll do them, argue why this is the best course of action to achieve  the results you intend to acquire. Because some readers may be from  interdisciplinary fields, take the time to explain &#8220;what parts of your  methodology are standard, and which are innovative.&#8221; Some ideas to  cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activities you plan to undertake to collect information</li>
<li>Techniques you will use to analyze the data</li>
<li>Tests of validity you will apply</li>
<li>Specify the archives, sources, and respondents</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, proposals should describe the end product. Will the grant  help to complete a dissertation chapter, a book, a digital project? Be  specific as to what the proposed outcome of this supported project will  be.</p>
<h4>End with the Beginning in mind&#8230;</h4>
<p>And begin with the  ending in mind, of course. It takes a long time to write a decent  proposal. Start early. Give yourself several weeks, or months if  possible. Write a first draft and set it aside for a day. Then revise  and set aside again. Ask others to take a look at it. Revise it again.  Make sure your opening paragraph is succinct, to the point, and  effective.</p>
<p>The closing of your proposal should reference the  beginning. If you mentioned a story or a specific and compelling reason  for the research, reference it again. The effect is to try and tie it  all up in a neat little package.</p>
<h4>Now, get back to work!</h4>
<p>Well, that all sounds really good. Now if I can just apply it to my proposals!</p>
