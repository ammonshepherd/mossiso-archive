										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not quite the same feeling and fun as a road trip, but fun enough.<br />
Yeah, archive work! Yeah, Germany! Yeah, yeah archive work in Germany! So I just spent the last two weeks in Germany (by myself, not so yeah) doing some archival research for the dissertation. Here are some thoughts on the trip.</p>
<h3>1. Internet!</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1368" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1368 " title="IMG_0141" alt="Starbucks" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-250x166.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-150x100.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141-624x416.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0141.jpg 1620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1368" class="wp-caption-text">The Starbucks with Internet&#8230; saved my bacon.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Make sure you have a good internet connection where you will stay. I booked a decent hotel with Internet included, and free breakfast. The only problem is, the connection to the Internet is spotty at best. I have to get a new user/pass combination to connect to the Internet every 24 hours, too. It&#8217;s so frustrating to want to communicate, but not be able to. Especially when you&#8217;re trying to get in touch with family back home. So, do some research and hope you get lucky. Also, it is important to know any quirks about the Internet in the country you go to, if going out side of the USA. In Germany, they use 13 channels for their routers, in the USA we only use 11. So if your place of stay uses channel 12 or 13, you&#8217;re almost out of luck. You can pick up a relatively cheap USB wireless adapter in the country that should get you all of their available channels. But you will most likely have to find some place with Internet to download software. Enter in the great Internet hubs scattered throughout the world: Starbucks and McDonalds! Even BurgerKing has Internet available. Find out where they are and use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. This is only a test.</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1372" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1372" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1372 " title="IMG_0209" alt="weinachtsmarkt" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-250x166.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-150x100.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209-624x416.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0209.jpg 1620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1372" class="wp-caption-text">Getting ready for Christmas!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Don&#8217;t get your hopes up too high for your first trip. I kind of went on this trip with the attitude that it would be a test run of a later real trip. This was possible because I know that I&#8217;m coming back in a few months. If you don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ll ever go back, then you need to do a lot of background research and contacting before hand. I had scheduled to go to the archive Tuesday through Friday the first week and Monday through Thursday the second week. The first day ended up being a get settled day; exchanging money, finding my way around, finding the Starbucks for Internet, etc. It often felt like I was wasting time, but if you know you are going to go back, then it is time well spent to get your bearings and figure things out. I lived in Germany for two years, but that was a life time ago (like 15 years ago). So I am a bit rusty on speaking German, and German customs, and such. Luckily that mostly all came back easily.</p>

<h3>3. Talk to me.</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1369" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1369" title="IMG_0193" alt="Divided" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-200x300.jpg 200w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-250x375.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-100x150.jpg 100w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193-624x936.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0193.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1369" class="wp-caption-text">A house divided&#8230; will make a good restaurant.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Talk with your contacts before leaving home. Or email them. Let them know exactly what you want to do, what you want to research, where you are going to look, etc. They can save you lots of time. I had one contact at the University of Freiburg, Professor Ulricht Herbert. I met with him twice, and he gave me sound advice. I should have emailed him more often before hand, but nothing really beats face to face contact anyway. My one contact here has turned into two or three. He also helped me realize I am trying to do too much in my dissertation. As it stands, its really a life&#8217;s work project. Going through the sources helped me understand that too. There is just way too much for me to be able to grasp it in two years time (my goal). Instead, I&#8217;m going to scale back and only cover one tunnel project, and cover that in depth. The reason there is no all encompassing history about the underground projects from World War II is because it was a huge project. Basically the whole of the German economy was turned to focus on these projects towards the end of the War. There is just too much to understand, too many documents to go through, and too much to grasp before this history can be written. That&#8217;s why nobody has done it, yet. It would take lots of financing and lots of time. Dr. Herbert suggested four years of work, but only after I had perfect understanding of German, have read all that has been written on the subject so far, and had an intimate grasp of Germany in World War II. That ain&#8217;t gonna happen in two years when I have a full-time job, a family, and no financial support. Perhaps that will be my ongoing project as a professor&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. I&#8217;ll make a note of that&#8230;</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1373" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1373" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1373" title="IMG_0211" alt="Schemmer" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-200x300.jpg 200w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-250x375.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-100x150.jpg 100w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211-624x936.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0211.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1373" class="wp-caption-text">Hotel Schemmer. Home away from home.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure out a good note taking routine. I have several hundred documents digitized from another archive already, and figured out a good naming scheme for them. I have a spread sheet for taking notes on each file, and for later import into Omeka for an online archive. This time around was a little different. The Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv in Freiburg had lots of documents for me to go through. Whereas before it was one collection/folder in one archive, I now had many collections/folders in one archive. So I had to figure out something a little different. I also didn&#8217;t have enough money to make digital copies of any of the records I found. It turned out that I didn&#8217;t need to make any, but that should be budgeted and planned for as well. There were a handful of documents that I wanted copies of, so I just transcribed them into a word processing document. I thought about making them plain text documents, but ran into a few formatting issues. I chose to make them LibreOffice (OpenOffice) Text documents, because there will always be a program that can open those, and that program is free. Of course, any program nowadays can open Microsoft Word documents, too, and there is no fancy formatting, so that would work fine too. One of my greatest struggles so far is keeping the documents in place chronologically. So my naming scheme for the files takes care of that. Start the name of the file with the year, then month number, then day number (YYYY-MM-DD), and the documents sort themselves! The file viewer (File Explorer for Windows or Finder for Macs) will usually sort by alphabet, so there&#8217;s nothing to it. Another thing I did was to go through the documents as quickly as I could. If It looked like it was helpful, I jotted notes about it, or quickly transcribed it. I will be able to go through the notes and transcriptions later to make sense out of them. That leads into the next point.</p>

<h3>5. Plan it right.</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1370" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1370" title="IMG_0197" alt="Trolly" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-250x166.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-150x100.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197-624x416.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0197.jpg 1620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1370" class="wp-caption-text">Trolly going through the tunnel.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Leave a day on either end for miscellaneous things. I unintentionally had a whole day with nothing to do. I was finished with the archives on Wednesday, and didn&#8217;t need to leave until Friday. That left me with the whole day on Thursday to tie things up and get ready to leave. I did some laundry, packed my bags and wrote this. It&#8217;s also a good time to go through the notes to make sure you don&#8217;t forget anything.</p>
<h3>6. Enjoy!</h3>
<p>The final tip is to just enjoy the time. If you&#8217;re in a foreign country, take a day to go see the sights. I had a weekend where the archive was not even open, so I spent the day walking around the awesome Altstadt (the oldest part of town, buildings from the 1400&#8217;s!). If you have funding for your trip, just think, who else gets paid to go look at old documents. Man, history is great! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;copy somebody&#8217;s code. Or at least your own from the past that works.</p>
<p>I finally got the map to work for my Exhibit exhibit. <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/ammon/clio3/tunnels.php">See</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I copied the tutorial <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Exhibit/2.0/Map_View_Tutorial">here</a>. When that was working, I carefully copied it to the file I wanted it to be in and&#8230; nothing. Still broken.</p>
<p>So next I commented out all extraneous stuff, and finally got it to work. Now came the fun part of tracking down what code was making my awesome map look like nothing. I narrowed it down to something within the &lt;header&gt; tag. So line by line I uncommented and tested until I tracked the issue down to the bootstrap.css file I was using.</p>
<p>Then came the same process within the bootstrap.css file. It was easily 1000 lines long, so a line by line process wasn&#8217;t going to work. Instead I commented out the first have of the file. Bing, the map displayed, so it was somewhere within that first 500 lines. Then I commented out the first 250 lines. Bing again. I kept dividing the culprits in half until I narrowed it down to styles for the img tag. Commented those out and I was in business.</p>
<p>Through that grueling process I lost the images of the documents on the first page. Now I have to figure out how to get those back, apply some styling and we&#8217;re all set.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t ever able to get it to pull in the data from a spreadsheet, so the JSON file will have to do. The process for making a JSON file from a spreadsheet is simple:</p>
<p>1. Make the spreadsheet file so that the headers are encapsulated with curly braces &#8216;{ }&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1361" title="Screen Shot 2012-10-11 at 6.44.16 PM" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM.png" alt="" width="800" height="76" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM.png 800w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM-300x28.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM-250x23.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM-150x14.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM-624x59.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>2. If you&#8217;re using Google spreadsheets, export it as an Excel file. You&#8217;ll have to open it in Excel and save it as an older file format, because the next step doesn&#8217;t like .xlsx.</p>
<p>3. Next, use <a href="http://service.simile-widgets.org/babel/">Similie&#8217;s Babel tool</a> to convert the spreadsheet to JSON.</p>
<p>4. Select &#8220;Excel&#8221; as the &#8220;from format&#8221; and &#8220;Exhibit JSON&#8221; as the &#8220;to format&#8221; and then browse to find the xls file you just made.</p>
<p>5. Click the &#8220;Upload and Convert&#8221; button.</p>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.50.19-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1360" title="Screen Shot 2012-10-11 at 6.50.19 PM" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.50.19-PM-1024x474.png" alt="" width="550" height="254" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.50.19-PM-1024x474.png 1024w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.50.19-PM-300x139.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.50.19-PM-250x115.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.50.19-PM-150x69.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.50.19-PM-624x289.png 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.50.19-PM.png 1294w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>6. The next screen is all of your spreadsheet data output into a nice JSON format.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, this was my first ever <a href="http://thatcamp.org/">THATCamp</a> experience. Seems hard to imagine since I have worked at CHNM since before the inception of THATCamp.  Ah, well, the stars finally aligned, and was able to attend this year. And it was great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attended three <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/">workshops</a> on Friday, and a <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/11/a-better-blogging-assignment/">couple</a> of <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/15/shell-tutorial/">sessions</a> on Saturday. Here are some thoughts&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/#data-mining">Digital Data Mining with Weka</a>: This was a neat <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~hrangwal/dhdm">crash course</a> on what data mining is and is not, and one free tool to help do some of that. It was more of a &#8220;here&#8217;s what&#8217;s out there, how does it apply to the humanities&#8221; than a hands on, hands dirty, do some real work type of work shop. But it was good in that it opened up the possibility to do some data mining in the future. Since they were relatively small, here my notes:</p>
<p>What is data mining?</p>
<p>examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>recommend ads, products to users based on purchases</li>
<li>finding patterns in large amounts of text (writing algorithms to find those patterns)</li>
</ul>
<p>Goal of data mining is to predict what users/people will do based on data from other users/people</p>
<p>Data mining Tasks: classification, clustering, association rule discovery, sequential pattern discovery, regression, deviation detection</p>
<p>Goal is to predict the classification (or whatever) of future data, based on the current data that you analyze.</p>
<p>Cross validation (when done correctly you get true results, when not done correctly you get false results)</p>
<p>have multiple sets of data, one for training and the other for testing. Build the algorithm on the training data, then run it on the test. Then cycle through each testing data set and have it act as a training set. Do this way because you know the results for each, so you can tell if your algorithm is correct. When it&#8217;s good then you can use it on future data where you don&#8217;t know the result.</p>
<p><a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/#git">Interesting Things You Can Do With Gi</a>t: This one was highly anticipated. I have been wanting/needing to learn git for a while now. For being in the IT field, having written some code, and even having a GitHub account with code on it, I&#8217;m ashamed to say I still don&#8217;t know how to use git effectively. There is not much you can do in 1.5 hours, and this was more a theoretical &#8220;here are some ideas&#8221;, than a &#8220;here is how to do it&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>The session on using <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/11/a-better-blogging-assignment/">blogs as assignments</a> was maybe a bit premature for me. The session was really good, great ideas, tips, etc. But me teaching is still too far away for me to have put the mental effort in to following along much. I spent most of the time trying to find a good twitter client, but in the end just stuck with <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>.</p>
<p>Then I took some time to enjoy the hacker space. I decided it was time, and this was the perfect place to set up a transcription tool for my dissertation archive. So sitting at the very table where it is coded, I installed the <a href="http://scripto.org/">Scripto</a> plugin for Omeka. That&#8217;s a bit of a misnomer, since it is really a wrapper that lets Omeka and a Wikimedia install play nicely together. I went ahead and transcribed one of the documents in the archive as well. The archive is just in the testing phase, but here it is anyways: <a href="http://nazitunnels.org/archive">http://nazitunnels.org/archive</a></p>
<figure id="attachment_1261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1261" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://nazitunnels.org/archive/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1261  " title="Screen Shot 2012-06-18 at 4.50.06 PM" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM.png" alt="" width="780" height="658" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM.png 975w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-300x252.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-250x210.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-150x126.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-624x526.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1261" class="wp-caption-text">Nazi Tunnels Archive</figcaption></figure>
<p>The final event of THATCamp for me was one last session proposed by a fellow &#8220;camper&#8221;. She wanted help <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/15/shell-tutorial/">learning about the shell</a>/terminal/command line. So I volunteered to help out with that. It ended up that there were about eight people that wanted help learning the command line, and four of us that knew what we were doing. So it ended up being a great ratio of help needed to those who could offer it. We started with the very basics, didn&#8217;t get much past a few commands (ls, cd, rm, nano, grep, cat), but we went slow enough that everybody who was trying to follow along was able to, and they all left with a clearer understanding of what the shell is for, and why it is useful. The proposer found a <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">great tutorial/book for learning the command line</a> that I&#8217;ll have to go through as well. You can always learn something new.</p>
<p>What was also great about that session, since it was basically ran by those who needed the help, I saw how those who struggle with these concepts learn them, so I will hopefully be better able to teach them to others in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I forgot to mention the many cool sites and projects mentioned during Saturday morning&#8217;s Dork Shorts. Here&#8217;s a list of the ones I took notice of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scrivener is awesome software for writing, that I&#8217;ve <a title="Nazi Tunnels" href="http://nazitunnels.org/2011/04/digging-in-to-the-dissertation.html" target="_blank">mentioned</a> before, but I had yet to really test out the integration with <a title="Zotero" href="http://www.zotero.org" target="_blank">Zotero</a> (my citation manager of choice). So now that I have finally started on my dissertation writing in earnest (and not grant writing), I needed to make sure that footnotes are usable in my work flow. So this is a quick write up of the tools I will use in writing my dissertation, and how I will use them.</p>
<h3>The Tools</h3>
<p><a title="Libre Office" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1191" title="images-1" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="47" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-1.jpg 398w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-1-300x95.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-1-250x79.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-1-150x47.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />LibreOffice</a>: Free and Open Source document software. Who knows how long I will have access to free Microsoft Word? LibreOffice (the fork of OpenOffice) will always be free and freely available. The steps will be basically the same if you are using Microsoft Word, just substitute that program for LibreOffice when it comes to it.</p>
<p><a title="Zotero" href="http://www.zotero.org" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p><a title="Zotero" href="http://www.zotero.org" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1192" title="images-2" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-2.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Zotero</a>: I&#8217;m certainly biased, but Zotero is the greatest citation management software evar! Also free and open source. I&#8217;m using the stand alone version, but you can use the Firefox extension as well. Should work the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Scrivener" href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1193" title="images" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images-150x150.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />Scrivener</a>: The greatest writing software I&#8217;ve seen. So good I even paid for it. I don&#8217;t usually do that with software (as you can see, I like <strong>free</strong> and <strong>open source</strong>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>Here I will try to outline the process I found that will save footnotes from existing documents into Scrivener, and Scrivener created footnotes into exported documents. From there, it&#8217;s easy to create Zotero connected footnotes.</p>
<h4>1. Copy existing documents with footnotes into Scrivener</h4>
<figure id="attachment_1213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1213" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/copy-from-libreoffice.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1213" title="copy-from-libreoffice" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/copy-from-libreoffice-300x289.png" alt="Copy from LibreOffice" width="300" height="289" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/copy-from-libreoffice-300x289.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/copy-from-libreoffice-250x240.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/copy-from-libreoffice-150x144.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/copy-from-libreoffice.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1213" class="wp-caption-text">Copy from LibreOffice</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first issue to run across is to put your existing documents into scrivener. I wrote a paper for Hist 811 that is basically the bulk of Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of the dissertation. It&#8217;s needs some finessing in order to fit in the dissertation. It would be a shame to lose the footnotes, which is what happens if you just use Scrivener&#8217;s import file process. This is an easy fix. Just copy the text from your document and paste it into a Scrivener text area.</p>
<p>Then with your Scrivener project open, create a new text area, or select an existing one, which ever, and paste it in. Nothing special there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Create new footnotes in Scrivener</h4>
<figure id="attachment_1212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1212" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paste-into-scrivener.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1212" title="paste-into-scrivener" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paste-into-scrivener-300x168.png" alt="Scrivener makes a Footnote" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paste-into-scrivener-300x168.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paste-into-scrivener-1024x575.png 1024w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paste-into-scrivener-250x140.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paste-into-scrivener-150x84.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paste-into-scrivener-624x350.png 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paste-into-scrivener.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1212" class="wp-caption-text">See how Scrivener makes a footnote!</figcaption></figure>
<p>What is special, though is what Scrivener does with that footnote. See there, footnote number 20, right after the quote about the cocktail of causes and rearmament being one of the ingredients? Now in Scrivener we have the word &#8220;ingredient&#8221; highlighted and underlined, and on the right side of the Scrivener window, there is a new footnote with all of the content of the original footnote. Sweet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_1216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1216" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/insert-footnote-scrivener.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1216" title="insert-footnote-scrivener" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/insert-footnote-scrivener-300x233.png" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/insert-footnote-scrivener-300x233.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/insert-footnote-scrivener-250x194.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/insert-footnote-scrivener-150x116.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/insert-footnote-scrivener-624x485.png 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/insert-footnote-scrivener.png 929w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1216" class="wp-caption-text">Easy as Format-&gt;Footnote, or use the shorcut keys Ctrl-Cmd-8</figcaption></figure>
<p>That&#8217;s all well and good. What if we want to edit the text a little bit, add some good stuff and add another footnote in there? What do we do? Well, Scrivener has a way to add a footnote. Just highlight some text (the footnote will be inserted after the last word), and go to the Format menu and select Footnote. Or you can use the fancy shortcut keys, for faster typing and footnote inserting, Ctrl-Cmd-8 (⌃⌘8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zotero makes it easy to put the reference in that new empty footnote with drag and drop citations. Just pull up your Zotero (either from Firefox, or if you have the standalone version). Select the reference you want, and drag it into the empty footnote section.</p>

<h4>3. Moving from Scrivener to a document, and keeping your footnotes!</h4>
<p>So, ideally, you would be able to export your text document, and all of these lovely footnotes you have made in Scrivener, using Zotero, would just magically work in a Word or LibreOffice document. It doesn&#8217;t, yet (or ever?). So here is how to get your footnotes into a document, and then get those footnotes to be Zotero enabled.</p>

<p>You will notice that all of your footnotes are in this file. Yeah! Sometimes the text had odd font sizes and styles. So a quick &#8216;Select All&#8217; and change it to default style and Times New Roman, 12 pt should fix that right up. Now here is the labor intensive part. For each footnote, we&#8217;re going to have to recreate it so that it is handled by Zotero. Then we&#8217;ll delete the original footnote. It would be nice of Scrivener could export the footnotes in a way that Zotero could detect them, but alas it is not to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you add a citation through the zotero buttons to make a zotero-aware citation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One alternative method is to create footnotes in Scrivener using the format {Author, Year, Page#}. Then export as an RTF document as before. Then, in Zotero, use the &#8216;RTF Scan&#8217; tool in the Preferences menu. Zotero will see all of the citations and replace them nicely with formatted citations (using Ibid. and short notation for repeat books, and such). Zotero will not be aware of these citations at all, so if you need them to be Zotero aware, you might as well use the steps outlined above. If you do not expect to update citations or the text once done in Scrivener, then this may be the easiest way to go.</p>
<p>Now I can happily transfer existing documents into Scrivener and save the footnotes!</p>

<h3>Like a block of stone</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 3. 2007: THE STONE IS WAITING by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/502043040/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/222/502043040_2be8463d8a_m.jpg" alt="MAY 3. 2007: THE STONE IS WAITING" width="240" height="194" /></a></p>
<p>I recently finished writing and rewriting and writing again the essays for several scholarship applications. It is probably a good thing, but that was the most time and effort I have ever spent writing three pages of text. I went through several revisions of each essay, had the wonderful Fulbright advisers at George Mason read and reread the essays, and even went to the vastly underused (by me anyways) campus writing center.</p>
<h3>Roughing it out</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 16. 2007 : DAY 14 by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/507181344/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/193/507181344_572d027046_m.jpg" alt="MAY 16. 2007 : DAY 14" width="240" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>My personal essay started out as being a little too personal, as in informal. At the writing center, I also realized that the opening paragraph was too negative. I wanted to show how as a child I deeply disliked school. In first and second grades, in order to avoid going to school I would often hide in the backyard or somewhere in the house, and generally make a big stink every morning. One time my mom drove me to school (two blocks away) and when we got there I jumped out of the car and ran off into the neighborhood for an hour or so. The rest of elementary school through high school was better; I did not put up as much of a stink, but I still did not like school. I was convinced that I would never have anything to do with school again once I graduated from high school. That&#8217;s how my essay started out, a general idea of what I wanted to write about. Like a big block of stone that I hacked away at.</p>
<h3>Adding Detail</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 22. 2007: DAY 20 by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/513546327/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/204/513546327_53d439b732_m.jpg" alt="MAY 22. 2007: DAY 20" width="177" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to convey all of that in a couple of sentences, all to point to the irony that I am now pursuing the highest degree one can attain in school, and that I am still in school 16 years later, with another three years to go (I did have three years off in there, though). But the gal at the writing center was right. It was a bit too negative. Instead I focused on my strengths as an historian and my technical skills. This worked out much better, since this is one of the major focuses of the dissertation. Through this constant revision and insight from others my project started to take shape.</p>
<h3>Finishing<br />
<a title="FINISHED AND ON ITS PLACE by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/1754287634/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2130/1754287634_b87cc656b6_m.jpg" alt="FINISHED AND ON ITS PLACE" width="179" height="240" /></a></h3>
<p>One of the other really neat things about spending so much effort on an essay (especially one about my dissertation research) is that I was really able to focus my arguments and tighten up my thoughts on what I hope to accomplish. Through this process of constant revision I realized three things that I wanted to focus on in my dissertation: the story of the underground dispersal projects; how the projects are memorialized or not, and what that says about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergangenheitsbewältigung">Vergangenheitsbewältigung</a>; and an argument for the change in what is considered scholarship in the historical profession. Going through the constant revisions has changed my focus in some small ways from my original proposal in the dissertation prospectus, but that is to be expected. I feel that I now have a much more polished and obtainable goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is cross-posted at my <a title="Writing Proposals" href="http://nazitunnels.org/2011/04/writing-proposals.html">dissertation site</a>.</p>
<p>I spent the day researching grants and reading about how to properly  put together a proposal. I also spent a bit of time plotting out my todo  list for this semester, creating a checklist of tasks and when they are  due. I made the list in my Google Calendar, so it&#8217;s not available to be  embedded on this site. I&#8217;ll have to work on finding a replacement or  something.</p>
<p>One of the places I&#8217;ll be applying to for a research grant is the Social Science Research Council (<a title="SSRC" href="http://www.ssrc.org" target="_blank">http://www.ssrc.org</a>).  They happen to have a short paper on how to best write a proposal for  their competitions, and being no dummy, I know I can apply these tips to  all the proposals I write. So here are some tips from their paper, &#8220;<a title="SSRC - Art of Writing Proposals" href="http://www.ssrc.org/publications/view/7A9CB4F4-815F-DE11-BD80-001CC477EC70/" target="_blank">On the Art of Writing Proposals</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Purpose of Proposals is to Persuade</h4>
<p>The main thing to realize when writing a proposal, is that you are  trying to persuade the approval committee that your project is better  than all the others. The trick is to do it in as short a space as  possible&amp;mdash;in the first paragraph, or at least the first  page&amp;mdash;while including all of the points the readers are looking  for. In the end you want the readers to associate you with your project  (Billy&#8217;s the guy researching blind Algerian water cave fish with  telepathic properties), rather than other mundane tidbits (Jane is the  gal from New York City, right?). It truly is an art.</p>
<h4>What do they want?!</h4>
<p>All scholarly projects require three basic merits: &#8220;conceptual  innovation, methodological rigor, and rich, substantive content.&#8221;  Additionally, the readers are going to be asking three questions that  the proposal needs to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are we going to learn?</li>
<li>Why do we need to know?</li>
<li>How do you prove it?</li>
</ul>
<p>And this all needs to be done initially very clearly, succinctly, and as forcefully as possible in the shortest amount of text.</p>
<h4>Let me be clear about this&#8230;</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that the individuals in the approval  committee come from varying disciplines. Therefore, the proposal needs  to be clear, free of the jargon typical of your discipline, all the  while explaining the boundary pushing or unique way your project  approaches your field. Keep the focus of the proposal on the ideas and  leave the technical aspects to an appendix. Make the first page explain  as clearly as possible what the topic is about, and what the  readers&amp;mdash;essentially, what the granting committee&amp;mdash;is  going to learn from this.</p>
<h4>So What!</h4>
<p>This is the crux of  the whole matter. Why in the world does anybody need to know about this?  What&#8217;s the point? Who cares? Why?! This is sometimes the hardest part  to figure out. I know it is for me. I continually mull this point over.  Do I really have a convincing and compelling reason. It seems for the  time being, for me, that my biggest compelling reason, my &#8220;so what?&#8221; is  because it hasn&#8217;t been researched before. While that may be a valid  reason, be careful. Others may conclude that there is adequate  justification for there to be no scholarship in the first place. There  are other aspects that make a research topic important and valid.  &#8220;Turning points, crucial breakthroughs, central personages, fundamental  institutions, and similar appeals to significance of of the object of  research are sometimes effective, if argued rather than merely asserted.</p>
<p>Apply  the topic to current political, economic or social debates. How is your  research not only timely but currently urgent, such that it provides a  new way to view current issues, or turn the direction of current  understanding?</p>
<p>Also try to be fresh and appealing in your  approach. Promote the apparent contradictions, extrapolate on puzzles,  and catch the readers off guard with surprises. Take the less traveled  path. If current trends lean towards one area of research, but your  topic can gyrate towards a new and fresh approach, take it!</p>
<p>Oh Yeah? Prove it!</p>
<p>It  is important for the proposal committee to know the methodology of your  approach. Do not just tell them what you will discover, but how you  intend to discover it. What types of sources, what means of debate, what  technology will be employed? But don&#8217;t just list out your tasks and how  you&#8217;ll do them, argue why this is the best course of action to achieve  the results you intend to acquire. Because some readers may be from  interdisciplinary fields, take the time to explain &#8220;what parts of your  methodology are standard, and which are innovative.&#8221; Some ideas to  cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activities you plan to undertake to collect information</li>
<li>Techniques you will use to analyze the data</li>
<li>Tests of validity you will apply</li>
<li>Specify the archives, sources, and respondents</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, proposals should describe the end product. Will the grant  help to complete a dissertation chapter, a book, a digital project? Be  specific as to what the proposed outcome of this supported project will  be.</p>
<h4>End with the Beginning in mind&#8230;</h4>
<p>And begin with the  ending in mind, of course. It takes a long time to write a decent  proposal. Start early. Give yourself several weeks, or months if  possible. Write a first draft and set it aside for a day. Then revise  and set aside again. Ask others to take a look at it. Revise it again.  Make sure your opening paragraph is succinct, to the point, and  effective.</p>
<p>The closing of your proposal should reference the  beginning. If you mentioned a story or a specific and compelling reason  for the research, reference it again. The effect is to try and tie it  all up in a neat little package.</p>
<h4>Now, get back to work!</h4>
<p>Well, that all sounds really good. Now if I can just apply it to my proposals!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To make this post not so boring, here&#8217;s a couple of pictures I put in my paper.

</p>
<p>After meeting with my dissertation and adviser and prof., we decided to make the paper more focused and helpful for the dissertation. So the plan is now to have this become an introductory chapter. I have done plenty of reading on Albert Speer, and digging through some archival documents, and that will still be helpful and apply to this paper, but the focus will be different.</p>
<p>I definitely need more books, but the ones listed in the last post are a good start.</p>
<p>Oh, man. A lot has transpired since I wrote the above, three weeks ago. The title still applies, and even more so. I turned in my first draft with good reviews from the class, but significant changes required from my dissertation advisor. So much to write about, so many tips and tricks I&#8217;ve picked up.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for writing a paper that I should have known already</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>So, first of all meet with your professors often. This is essential to stay on target. Meet at every step: beginning and deciding on the topic; bibliography; outline; first draft; second draft; final draft.</li>
<li>Make an outline! Man, why did I not do this more often in the past? This was a life saver in helping me formulate thoughts, figure out what was important and what was just an interesting tangent. One of the best benefits of an outline, I found, was that it made the reading more focused. Granted, it took a book or two to figure out what was important about the topic, but making the outline made reading the books easy. I didn&#8217;t have to plod through each book, cover to cover. Instead I sought out the parts of the book that helped fill in the outline. Awesome!</li>
<li>Peer review. This was a required part of the course. We all got to read another classmate&#8217;s paper and critique/review it. It was neat to see how the reviewer always had some neat aspect or idea that really helped flesh out the topic even more. (I&#8217;ll blog about the awesome and pivotal ideas that Mark gave about my paper.)</li>
</ol>
<p>So there are three good tips. Now I have some more-than-minor rewrites and additional research to do for the version of the paper for class, and some major rewriting and researching to do for the version for my dissertation advisor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not that I really have time to blog as I do it, but&#8230; I feel like I need to do something historical here&#8230; So why not.</p>
<figure id="attachment_358" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-358" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-358" title="Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-358" class="wp-caption-text">Tunnel at Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (German: Markirch), in Alsace, France</figcaption></figure>
<p>So this is my last class before embarking on my dissertation. The Graduate Research Seminar should hopefully tie up any loose knots in our historical writing abilities. It&#8217;s a course on honing our skills. The syllabus looks great, and I&#8217;m excited for the class. One initial question I had was, why are we learning how to write like historians until the very end? Why don&#8217;t we learn how to write at the beginning or even in the middle? Well, there is a course or two on that, but nothing like this one proposes to be. We&#8217;re apparently going to learn all the behind-the-scene techniques and tricks to the trade. I&#8217;m actually really excited for it. Our Professor is great.</p>
<p>So for this class we&#8217;re supposed to write a 25-30 page paper that will hopefully become a chapter (or at least a bulk of one) of the dissertation. If nothing else, it can be a publishable paper. On the very low end, it will at least teach us something we don&#8217;t want to do for a dissertation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_357" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-357" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-357" title="Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-357" class="wp-caption-text">Map of tunnel locations</figcaption></figure>
<p>My dissertation, as it stands now, is on Nazi Tunnels. The Nazis, towards the middle of the war, decided that they needed to move much of their war manufacturing underground. So they designed and built huge underground bunkers and tunnel systems for factories and depots. Go ahead, google it. There&#8217;s not much out there. Add the keywords, &#8216;melk ebensee&#8217; and you&#8217;ll get a few more responses. The only scholarly works that I know of on this topic are two German books. One is an excellent work by Hans Walter Wichert, <em>Decknamenverzeichnis deutscher unterirdischer Bauten</em>(at <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Decknamenverzeichnis-deutscher-unterirdischer-zweiten-Weltkrieges/dp/3980327140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264723732&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon</a>, already have one), which lists practically all of the underground building sites during Nazi Germany. The second work is a dissertation by Bertrand Perz, <em>Projekt Quarz: Steyr-Daimler-Puch Und Das Konzentrationslager Melk, Industrie, Zwangsarbeit und Konzentrationslager in O?sterreich</em> (<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Das-Konzentrationslager-Melk-Steyr-Daimler-Puch-Projekt/dp/3706541858/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264723686&amp;sr=8-1">at Amazon</a> if anyone wants to buy it for me), which is an in-depth look at one of these underground projects in Melk, Australia.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there are totally no sources available, to my knowledge, that I can use for the current project. That&#8217;s part of my dissertation work, is to dig up all of those sources. It should be fun. It&#8217;s also not manageable in a semester&#8217;s time. So for this semester&#8217;s project I had several ideas.</p>
<figure id="attachment_359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-359 " title="ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359" class="wp-caption-text">Projekt Quarz</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, I thought about doing a micro-study on just one of the tunnels. Unfortunately, in the two or three hours of looking for sources, I couldn&#8217;t find any. I haven&#8217;t checked with the library, yet, but I&#8217;m not hopeful. So my second idea is to look at a more broad topic that touches the issue of the tunnels. One obvious one is, why did they build them in the first place (the answer is to protect them from Allied bombings). But a deeper question begs, why did they think they could do that in the first place. It was a huge undertaking to move so many factories underground. They must have though they could do it. So a deeper question would be, why did the Nazi&#8217;s think they could undertake such a big job. Now let&#8217;s step back a bit, say, 30-50 years, and apply this question to Germany as a whole in the form of, what did German&#8217;s think of their technical and scientific abilities? So that will be my basis of inquiry for this semester&#8217;s project. I will look at what German citizens, German scientists, and German politicians thought about German science and technology from 1900 until the end of World War II. I post more on this as I think it through and find sources.</p>
<p>So, basically, I&#8217;m hoping to keep up the blog as I write the paper and take the class. I&#8217;ll post the methodology that I learn, and the troubles and trials, the triumphs and tackles about writing a historical paper.</p>
<p>First off, I feel completely unprepared because I have no sources. That&#8217;s the first thing to tackle.</p>
