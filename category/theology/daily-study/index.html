<p>1 Corinthians 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>



<p>We can readily see the importance of taking care of our physical/natural body. We must feed it, rest it, wash it, exercise it.</p>



<p>Do we likewise take care of our spiritual body?</p>



<p>How do we feed, rest, wash and exercise our spiritual body?</p>



<p>We must feed it truth, learning, wisdom, and knowledge from books and other media. We must feed it good, uplifting, wholesome interactions with others.</p>



<p>We rest our spiritual body with meditation, prayer, mindfulness, positive self-talk.</p>



<p>We wash our spirit through the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ&#8217;s atonement for our souls. We use his enabling power to overcome habits we don&#8217;t want with habits we do want. We rid our mind of impure thoughts, our bodies of hurtful actions. We clean our spirits by removing from our thoughts anything that is undesirable, that does not help us become what we want to be.</p>



<p>We exercise our spirits through doing things that are hard; hard work, new skills, healthy thinking patterns, etc. When we have to choose mind over matter. When we choose long term benefit and short term loss over short term gain and long term loss. </p>

Talmage" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/04/james_e_talmage.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2010/04/james_e_talmage.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2010/04/james_e_talmage-112x150.jpg 112w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-231" class="wp-caption-text">James E. Talmage</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been struggling to find a topic or study practice to keep my studies coherent. I was prompted to start reading &#8220;Jesus the Christ&#8221; by James E. Talmage.</p>
<p>I only have a copy in German, from my mission, so this will be interesting (unfortunately my German skills have deteriorated). Of course it is available in many languages for free on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22542/22542-h/22542-h.htm" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>. So I may have to reference that quite often.</p>
<p>Talmage makes seven points from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that are specific to the understanding of Jesus Christ and which are different than any other church&#8217;s beliefs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Christ&#8217;s mission extends before and after his earthly life.</li>
<li>He belonged to the Godhead before his life on earth.</li>
<li>He was literally the son of a God and a mortal mother</li>
<li>His physical death and physical resurrection really did happen, and as a result the power of death has been overcome (much more to be written on that later, but basically, because Jesus had the ability to make his spirit and body reunite after separating through death, he will give everyone who has died the power to reunite their spirit and body. The LDS Church, I think, is unique in believing this will happen for every single person who lived on the earth.)</li>
<li>The Atonement is a reality, it really did happen, and anybody who follows Christ&#8217;s gospel will be able to use it.</li>
<li>Jesus&#8217; power (the priesthood) and his church are restored in this time period, which is called the &#8220;dispensation of the fullness of times&#8221; in the scriptures</li>
<li>Jesus Christ will really come again in a relatively short time, and will personally and physically be the king and Lord of earth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, my translations aren&#8217;t that bad. Each of those points could be a book&#8230; or at least a nice blog post. 🙂</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday in Priests Quorum, we were discussing some attributes found in the &#8220;For the Strength of Youth&#8221; pamphlet. Serving others came up as a way to show gratitude, one of the attributes we need to develop. It struck me then, as it has before, that serving others is the key to becoming like God. I expressed this feeling to the boys, too.</p>
<p>I said to the boys, &#8220;Do you want to know what the key is to be a God?&#8221; They of course did. I told them it was written on the board. I told them to look at Christ&#8217;s life. For whom did he do every single thing that he did in life? It was for others. All of the miracles, the healing, the feedings, the teachings, were for the benefit of others. Only one time is it recorded what his desires were. That was in the Garden of Gethsemane, as he was to atone for the sins of all people. He said, if it be at all possible, I don&#8217;t want to do this, BUT I will do what somebody else wants me to, I&#8217;ll do the will of God.</p>
<p>Likewise, we know the purpose of God&#8217;s existence. It&#8217;s found in Moses 1:39, &#8220;For behold, this is my work and my glory-to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.&#8221; The whole purpose of God, the basis of his glory, his power, his right to be a God, is based in others. His power comes because he is completely involved in helping his children. The key to becoming a God is to forget yourself and serve others.</p>

		<p>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that <em>is</em> thy neighbour’s.</p>
<p>How much nicer our lives would be if we were just happy with what we have.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it ironic that we have scads of TV shows where people get their perfectly usable kitchens, homes, bedrooms, bathrooms, whatever, remodeled, and yet there are so many in the world who don&#8217;t even have a home, let alone a perfectly good usable one. Our society is so stuck on needing bigger and better instead of just being happy with what they have. I grew up in a home with three bedrooms and one bathroom. We had nine (9) people in the family. We learned to get along really well. There were four boys in one small room, just big enough for two bunk beds, four dressers, and a space to sit down on the floor. All of us are great friends. We learned to live with what we had, and learned to be happy with it. Sure we would have loved a second or third bathroom. Believe me, we would have loved it.</p>
<p>My mother and wife are great examples of people who do not coveting the things of others. They often want things, but are always quick to check themselves and be happy for things that they already have.</p>
<p>There would be so much less greed, dishonesty, corruption and ill feelings if people would just be happy with what they have.</p>
<p>A great talk on this commandment is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=9c1f2150a447b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD">Gordon B. Hinckley, “‘Thou Shalt Not Covet’,” <em>Ensign</em>, Mar 1990, 2</a></p>
<p>A great quote comes from a seminal talk on the Ten Commandments by President Ezra Taft Benson (<a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=dbc0b8c96c89b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=024644f8f206c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD">Ezra Taft Benson, 		 					  “America at the Crossroads,” 				  <em>New Era</em>, 		Jul 1978, 	36</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ezra_taft_benson.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-224 alignright" title="ezra_taft_benson" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ezra_taft_benson.jpg" alt="" width="92" height="120" /></a>&#8220;10. Last, “Thou shalt not covet.” (<a onclick="newWindow('http://scriptures.lds.org/ex/20//17#17')" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/ex/20/17#17" target="contentWindow">Ex. 20:17</a>.) Covetousness is one of the besetting sins of this generation, and our covetousness reaches every item forbidden in the commandments—our neighbor’s house, his wife, his help, his worldly goods, and everything that is our neighbor’s. Covetousness, plus love of idleness, lie at the root of our violation of the law of work, with all the ills that has brought. Covetousness has invaded our homes, our communities, the nations of the world. It has brought with it greed, and avarice, and ambition, and love of power. Men scheme, plan, overreach, cheat, and lie to get their neighbor’s heritage. Covetousness threatens the peace of the world today more than any other one element. But God said, “Thou shalt not covet.”&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And in closing out this study of the Ten Commandments are some closing thoughts by Ezra Taft Benson from this same talk.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These are the foundation principles upon which all civilized government and our present civilization is built. To disregard them will lead to inevitable personal character loss and ruin. To disregard them as a nation will inevitably lead that nation to destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember a number of years ago when Cecil B. DeMille, the great producer of the film <em>The Ten Commandments, </em>was invited to accept an honorary degree from Brigham Young University. In his address to the student body, Mr. DeMille made this interesting observation. He said that men and nations cannot really break the Ten Commandments; they can only break themselves against them. How true that is!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

		<p>This is a pretty easy one, to see how the world would be better without lying, cheating, slander, gossip, and all of those negative forms of communication. Just think of elementary school alone. How much better would everyone&#8217;s self esteem be, if there were no put downs, no name calling, no teasing. I can think of several unfortunate episodes right off the bat that would no longer harrow my memory.<a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pinocchio1.gif"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-218" title="pinocchio1" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pinocchio1.gif" alt="" width="300" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>The commandment is to not bear false witness against thy neighbor. One questions, put to rest right here, is &#8216;Who is my neighbor&#8217;? Obviously, according to the parable of the good Samaritan, our neighbor is everyone else. To bear false witness, is to give wrong testimony, to lie.</p>
<p>A lie is a deliberately false statement. We could get into technicalities of what would constitute a lie in this or that situation, but let&#8217;s be real, here. A lie is when we don&#8217;t tell the truth. These commandments are trying to get us to act like God. (As was commanded us, see <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/matt/5/48#48">Matthew 5: 48</a> and <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/3_ne/12/48#48">3 Nephi 12: 48</a>) God does not lie. The manner of speaking for the Godhead (Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit) is that of truth (see <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/jacob/4/13#13">Jacob 4: 13</a>). There would be no deception, our courts would be much emptier, things would cost less for lack of law suits against doctors and business, we could trust strangers. A movie came out recently in which people only speak the truth, and apparently have to say what they are thinking, even if it is blunt and cruel. Well, the main character discovers the lie, something unthinkable. The movie is about how he uses, misuses, and abuses the lie. I didn&#8217;t see the movie, but I doubt that it ends well (rated PG-13, which means inapropriate  jokes about sex, probably some nudity, and more than likely a defunct moral outcome. All good reasons to avoid it.)</p>
<p>Some other thoughts and scriptures on being honest and not lying:</p>
<p><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/prov/19/22#22">Proverbs 19: 22</a> &#8211; The poor man is better than a liar. I&#8217;m poor (relatively speaking), so I find comfort in this scripture. I try hard to be honest, so even if I&#8217;m poor, at least I&#8217;m better than a liar.</p>
<p><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/acts/5/4#4">Acts 5: 4</a> &#8211; When you lie, it is against God.</p>
<p><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/2/18#18">2 Nephi 2: 18</a> &#8211; Lying is the language of Satan. Who wants to be like him?</p>
<p><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/9/34#34">2 Nephi 9: 34</a> &#8211; And my favorite, it&#8217;s always fun to say this scripture. A liar&#8217;s place is hell, not pushed, not shoved, not kicked, but thrust.</p>

		<p>This commandment is again about our relationship to others.</p>
<p>This commandment shows importance of personal belongings, respecting others, acknowledging the existence and rights of others (sometimes over our own rights), and manners. From childhood we are taught the importance of not stealing. When a child takes a toy from another child, the parents instruct the child that it is not OK to take from others. Yet how often do we steal time from employers, steal trust from family, and rob God of his tithes? There is much more than just material goods that can be stolen.</p>
<p>A great article on this commandment is found here: <a href="http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=910f55c49e0eb010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=f318118dd536c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD" target="_blank">Richard D. Draper, &#8220;&#8216;Thou Shalt Not Steal&#8217;,&#8221; <em>Liahona</em>, Oct 1998, 27</a>. He has many points worth repeating.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Often that is the way it is with theft—more is stolen than material goods. When someone breaks the eighth commandment, victims lose not only their peace, but also possessions that represent bits of their lives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the item or thing that is stolen, but it&#8217;s the time and effort the individual put into making or caring for the thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Bible emphasizes that stealing belongs to the set of sins that includes murder, adultery, and false swearing. All of these are directly related, and theft is the common link; murder is the unlawful taking of life, adultery concerns the taking of virtue, and false swearing usually involves the taking of reputation, property, or goods.</p>
<p>The sentence “Thou shalt not steal” (<a onclick="newWindow('http://scriptures.lds.org/ex/20//15#15')" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/ex/20/15#15" target="contentWindow">Ex. 20:15</a>) includes no object. Its prohibition is broad and unconditional: You shall not steal anything.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I like how he emphasizes that the law is broad. We should not steal anything. That includes so much, even things covered in the previous commandments. It enforces the fact that there are God given rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Brother Draper suggests that this commandment teaches us at least three important principles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Private ownership of property is a God given right and responsibility. God commanded Adam and Eve to eat their bread by the sweat of their own work, not through the work of anyone else.</li>
<li>God is the source of the right of private ownership, not man or the state. He is the one that dictates the laws that govern humanity.</li>
<li>Stealing is a sin against God. All divine laws originate from him, so breaking this law is a sin against God.</li>
</ol>
<p>Draper also points out that regardless of the circumstance, stealing is still a sin.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Stealing is a sin against our Heavenly Father even when motivated by need and poverty. The act dishonors God (see <a onclick="newWindow('http://scriptures.lds.org/prov/30//9#9')" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/prov/30/9#9" target="contentWindow">Prov. 30:9</a>). Conversely, the honest person who chooses not to steal, even under stressful circumstances, shows trust in God. He is conscious of a covenant relationship with the Lord and chooses to sustain it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>To take without permission, even if you&#8217;re starving or your children are starving, is still stealing, and is a sin. Ironically, just today, a co-worker used that condition (starving family) to justify being dishonest.</p>
<p>Stealing violates another commandment given to us by God. We were commanded to subdue the earth and have dominion over the animal kingdom, but only as we followed God&#8217;s counsel and laws. When we misuse our dominion and seek power over others, we are stealing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we are wise, we will love people and use things, as our Father intended. Immorality occurs when we love things and use people. The awful idea Satan taught Cain was how to turn human life into property, how to make a child of God less than chattel.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Draper concludes by admonishing that we need a return to the basic first law of God, that we love Him and one another.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;President Spencer W. Kimball pointed out that “honesty can be taught but not legislated. ‘There ought to be a law,’ many say when corruption raises its ugly head, and our answer is that there are laws—numerous laws which are not enforced; but our further answer is that you cannot legislate goodness and honor and honesty. There must be a return to consciousness of those values.” When people practice those values, the power of the Spirit and the force of love can do what the law cannot—overcome the greed and covetousness that lead to stealing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If all people were to follow this commandment, there would be less greed, less hate. Greed is the source of most stealing, I would say. When people respect others and their property, there is no thievery.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The seventh commandment is another one dealing with the relationship between humans.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, my brother-in-law was married. The sealer who performed the marriage made a comment about this commandment. He said that if this one single commandment were kept, there would not be so much evil and wrong in the world.  He said most of the problems with society can be traced back to the lack of people keeping this commandment.</p>
<p>Jesus, in speaking to the Nephites, takes this commandment to a higher level. He says that if you even look at another to lust after them, you have committed adultery in your heart. Not only should we not act, but we should stay away from letting those thoughts into our heart.</p>
<p>Satan wants to destroy our ability to progress. He wants to distort and pervert the things we have that he does not. Two things Satan can not have, due to his rebellion, are a family and a body. Looking at American society now, we can see that the body and the family are under attack. People are trying hard to re-define what a family is, couching it in terms of social and personal justice and choice. Some equate the fight against the traditional definition of family with the <a title="Civil Rights Movements" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955%E2%80%931968%29" target="_blank">civil rights movements of the African-Americans</a>. Perhaps a better comparison is to equate it with the fight against <a title="Prohibition in the US" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Prohibition</a> in the 1920&#8217;s. I digress&#8230; In today&#8217;s society, the family is less about mother, father and children as a unit of progression and love, it seems. People emphasize the individual and have a hard time thinking about others. A central purpose of families is to make you think about others and not yourself. Perhaps the main reason people commit adultery is because of selfishness. They think only of their own desires, wants and needs. Instead of putting forth the hard effort of working out issues with a spouse, they seek the quick and easy way out. But that only leads to more trouble.</p>
<p>Satan also can never have a physical body. Because of this, he does everything he can to make people misuse their bodies. Our society is so infatuated with sensual things. Just look at what our society focuses on. In the movies and T.V. there seems to always be a reference to sex, if not full out portrayal of it. Magazines and music, books and just about every form of entertainment seems to incorporate the carnal side of sex. This is just what Satan wants. If he can get people so focused on sex, if he can make it so mainstream and common place, then people will have no problem abusing it.</p>
<p>So what happens when this commandment is obeyed. First of all, the family remains intact. Fathers and mothers love each other and are faithful. There are numerous studies that show that children without a stable family life don&#8217;t do as well as those with a stable family. I&#8217;m sure you can pick any number of people you know and find how that is true. How many fights, wars, and deaths have been the result of breaking this commandment? Those would all be done away with. There would be no prostituting of bodies in order to make money, or in the name of &#8220;art&#8221; or entertainment. Our Hollywood stars seem more like porn stars than actors and actresses. Anyhow, a lot of good would come from keeping this commandment.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="../../../2009/12/05/ttc-6-thou-shalt-not-kill/index.html" rel="bookmark">TTC #6 &#8211; Thou shalt not kill</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Commandment number 6, &#8220;thou shalt not kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The footnote to the LDS version expounds &#8220;kill&#8221; to mean murder. This is one of the most heavy, or hard to forgive sins. Alma instructs his son Corianton that the three most grievous and hard to forgive sins are to deny the Holy Ghost, to shed innocent blood, and sexual immorality. Murder is so hard to repent of for a number of reasons. First, part of repentance is to restore anything that was taken or removed, etc. Well, it&#8217;s impossible for anyone but Christ to restore life to a dead person. So it&#8217;s almost impossible to repent of murder. Likewise, with the other two, you can&#8217;t restore virtue and you can&#8217;t take back a denial of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>But what about situations where the Lord has commanded that people be killed? Does that not violate his own law? Some examples of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abraham commanded to kill/sacrifice Isaac &#8211; Genesis 22: 1-14</li>
<li>Saul commanded to destroy and kill all of the Amalekites (men, women, children, live stock, everything) &#8211; 1 Samuel 15</li>
<li>Nephi prompted by the Holy Ghost to kill Laban &#8211; 1 Nephi 4: 10-14</li>
</ul>
<p>A part of this answer is found in a quote from Joseph Smith. &#8220;God said, &#8216;Thou shalt not kill;&#8217; at another time He said, &#8216;Thou shalt utterly destroy.&#8217; This is the principle on which the government of heaven is conducted &#8211; by revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the kingdom are placed. Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is, although we may not see the reason thereof till long after the events transpire&#8221; (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 256.) Sounds like blind obedience. Well, when the one you are following is a perfect God, then such obedience is OK. But rarely is it blind with God. It seems he will always provide enough understanding, sometimes after the trial of our faith, though.</p>
<p>The commandment not to kill might be expanded to include all living animals. I&#8217;m not sure if plants are considered alive. Of course one meaning of living might define having a spirit as part of being alive. D&amp;C 77: 2, is revelation to Joseph about Revelations 4: 6, wherein he says &#8220;that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual,&#8221; but limits that to man and beast, not plants. In any case, there is a difference between beasts and plants which makes it OK to kill and eat plants without any fear of breaking commandment 6 (see D&amp;C 89: 14,17 &#8211; for the Word of Wisdom commandments that tell us specifically to eat plants and grains). Beasts should only be killed in times of winter, cold, famine and excess of hunger (see D&amp;C 89: 12-15).</p>
<p>Also, in 3 Nephi 12: 21-26, Jesus says not only should we not kill, but we should also not be angry!</p>
<p>How much of the wrongs and the evils of the world are caused by anger? If we would follow the commandment to not kill, and the deeper meaning from Jesus to not even be angry, then that would probably solve 90% of the things wrong with humanity.</p>

<p>This is the first commandment with a promise or consequence for following it (previous ones had consequences for NOT following). If you honor your parents you will live a long life. Since it seems just about every person who has lived on the earth didn&#8217;t want to die, that&#8217;s a great blessing. Well, what does it mean to honor your parents? The footnote to honor in the LDS scriptures suggests that we must respect and value our parents. Deuteronomy 5: 12 adds that it will go well with us as well as living long.</p>
<p>Honoring our parents puts us in a similar frame of reference as our relationship with God. Our parents gave us our lives. Your mother gave birth to you; that took a lot of time, energy, money, and personal sacrifice. You would not exist if it weren&#8217;t for your parents. That deserves respect. Similarly, we would not exist if it weren&#8217;t for God allowing our spiritual births and providing for our physical existence through the Plan of Happiness.</p>
<p>If everyone were to honor their parents, there would be greater respect for others generally as well. There would be less rejection of good traditions, less teenage rebellion and rejection of good morals, more honesty, and stronger families.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So, the 4th Commandment, the Sabbath day. This is perhaps my biggest pet-peeve about the Christian world. Everyone who claims to be a Christian should follow and obey the Ten Commandments. Jesus said, &#8220;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven&#8221; (see <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/matt/5/17-19/#17">Matthew 5:17-19</a>). The &#8220;law&#8221; and the &#8220;prophets&#8221; that he refers to are the laws from the Old Testament, including the Ten Commandments. True he came to fulfil the law, to bring us to a higher level of living and being, but these basic Ten Commandments must still be followed. They are stepping stones, so that once we have mastered them, we can move on to mastering others.</p>
<p>Yet, most of the Christian world does not follow this 4th Commandment. Maybe I am harsh, but society used to be a measure of mainstream Christianity, and, well, society definitely does not follow this Commandment, nor any of them, really. I wonder if the teachers and preachers in other denominations, other than the LDS, teach the commandment to keep the Sabbath day holy. If they do, the people aren&#8217;t obedient.</p>
<p>There is so much to discover and learn about this commandment, that it&#8217;s a bit overwhelming. It&#8217;s so clear and plain in the scriptures, I&#8217;m confused how so many people can&#8217;t/won&#8217;t/don&#8217;t follow it. It is basic; don&#8217;t work on the Sabbath. In fact, don&#8217;t even make others work. If you have animals that work for you, don&#8217;t let them work either! Pretty simple.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the issue of which day is the Sabbath. If the week has always been Sunday through Saturday, then at the time the Ten Commandments were given, the Sabbath would fall on Saturday. Saturday would be the seventh day, the day God rested after creating the heavens, the earth and all living things. It&#8217;s interesting, and important to note, that God says he rested from his labors. He proclaims the work good, even very good, but he doesn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s done. The creator is Jesus Christ, and his work is not done with the Creation. The last words of Jesus, as he was on the Cross and completing his earthly life and therefore the closing stages of the Atonement, where &#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; (Matt 27:46; Mark 15:34), then &#8220;Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit&#8221; (Luke 23:46), and finally, &#8220;It is finished&#8221; (John 19:30). That was when Jesus could say that he &#8220;finish[ed God&#8217;s] work&#8221; (John 4:34). With the Resurrection happening on the Sunday, the Sabbath was moved by the Christian believers to Sunday in honor and remembrance of the Atonement and Resurrection. Sunday is now the Sabbath, and should be a day of rest, a day of no worldly work, and a day to remember and honor and worship our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of what, specifically, one should and should not do on the Sabbath. Many a list can be made, but basically, we are to do that which worships and serves God. This, again, is a commandment for us to be able to focus on God.</p>
<p>So what problems can be solved when this commandment is followed? Well, I think our society here in America is suffering much from the lack of following this commandment. When the Sabbath has proper place in our lives, we will find that we are more focused on God and others rather than ourselves. What do most people do instead of worship and serve on the Sabbath? They work or do recreational activities. They work to get gain, improve their financial standing, they work to get money, money to buy things. It is something focused on self, the root cause is pride. Or they do recreational things, again the root of it is pride, being selfish. If businesses kept their doors closed on the sabbath, and if people worshiped God and served others on that day, then the businesses would do better (there are many a story of this), and people would be focused on others, people would be more happy, the family would begin to be more central in people&#8217;s lives again. The sabbath is about putting priorities in place, putting God&#8217;s ways above our own.</p>
