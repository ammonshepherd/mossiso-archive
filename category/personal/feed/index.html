<p>Petra:</p>



<p>So I went to school. And I was sooo excited, because I love school. When I was in the hallway near ms edwards, she said Hi Petra we have Alex already in our class. She’s staying her all week. This week. Then we did lots of fun games. We went to music and played with xylophones and glockenspiels. And we had this thing that said, it was a video actually, about Christmas music. And then we did tests, two tests, mostly math tests. Then we had two short recesses. Then we did lots of other math tests, then after all of them we did center time. I colored and jogged on the trampoline. Then we colored more. And then we played on the trampoline more on center time. Then we did lots of more things that I forgot. Then we had lunch.</p>



<p>And we were watching a magic school bus video. Then there was more stuff. And then we did lots of math. And then, the principal said on the speaker on the wall that the teachers hadded to take the class out by themselves. Then we played a lot. And then we goed back inside the classroom. Then we cleaned the desks and the chairs and the bins. And then we got our backpacks on and watched something. And then the principal called the classes, the first class that the principal called was the kindergarten class. And then he called out the first grade and second grade class. Then we walked all the way and some other kids including me went down the other hallway. One left and went with me to the gym. Then the principal called out all the names in the gym when their parents came to pick them up. We were the last. And then they called out us (Asher, Anthea and me). Then we went down the concrete pathway. Then we went more left. And we stopped and turned straight. Then I opened this door to the suburban. And then daddy said “How was school kids?” Then we all said Fun, except for Asher. Asher said, “I hated school. I don’t want to go there anymore.” And then we drived to the library. And daddy got a book. The last book of Martin Luther King Jr before he died. And then he got buckled and he started driving home. Then we played a lot until it was dinner time. Then we did the thing that we’re doing right now. It was all on Wednesday. And I’m almost done with this story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jonas:</p>



<p>I went to school for one class. I did some scholarship stuff. Played some video games. Had a meeting with Priests to make our own knives.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ArlzzGMYnGXQxgXiOJ6OdMyE0NrjBmirPyspW9QcyLJWRHMoacizMFeKV1EGzbIyKfFLuwYRRc69WIizUtlkifAY9uy-dnjGMKBrRGq8eYbjcxz-Oovsv7XEKLXVx6nH7rbJnyZo" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Teancum:</p>



<p>Well, I woke up. Then I layed in bed for 10 minutes with my parents nagging at me to get ready for school. Then I got ready for school and we had prayer. Then we drove to school. Then I went to school. And during the 1st block thing we had a fire drill and I only saw only one other person wearing shorts, but the teachers called me out for not wearing pants because I don’t have any. 36 degrees Farenheith Coach Stevens (XC coach) said she would take me shopping. And then I went through all my classes. In band there were 2 other people, but one was absent. In english there were 4 but one absent. After that was science in which there are 2 other people. In civics there are 2 other people and Math there is one other person. And then I went on the bus. And since there was a bus change I had to tell the driver where I lived. And then we went there. And then I walked off the bus and then I went to the door and opened it. And I went into the kitchen and put down my water bottle and Dad said Yay Tac is home or something along those lines, and mom didn’t even know because she was in a coach call or something. Then I put my stuff away and ate a snack. Then I did some zoom classes. And then I cubed. And then we had dinner and then mutual thingy. We had scriptures and prayer. And then I made popcorn. I ate the popcorn. I went up stairs and got interviewed by dad to see what I was up to today. And then Mom got mad at me for not wearing pants. And at present moment. I will probably go brush my teeth and read a book for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Anthea:</p>



<p>Umm, giggle. Giggle giggle giggle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I went to school in the car with January and Petra and Asher (and the rest of the family) with my backpack and laptop. When we were almost there we put on our masks (me, Petra and Asher). When we got there, our temperatures were taken, one by one. Petra was last. Asher was first. And I was the 2nd. After I got my temperature taken I got out of the car and walked up the stairs to my class. Before I went in my classroom I went to go get breakfast. After I got my breakfast, I went into my classroom and went to my seat. Which is in the right corner in the front (I can’t see very well there, so I usually move in the middle of math, but that’s my spot). I ate my breakfast while I did my morning work. The kids behind me and next to me were being very annoying while I did it so I moved to a table behind me in the back. I worked there quietly for a few minutes and then I went back to my seat because the kids had quieted down. Then I finished my work. Then after all of the kids were coming today had came, the teacher started the lesson. I can’t exactly remember what happened first, but I know we did some math. Then we did some reading. Then we had snack. After that we went to block which was music. Then we did some math, which was regular math with numbers and stuff. And then we did some word problems. Then we had lunch. Then we did more math. And then we did recess. And then more math. And then the announcement called for us to go home. I went to the gym and waited. Then after a few minutes in the gym they called me, Petra and Asher. We went out of the gym and then we walked down the path to the car. And Dad took us home. The End. just kidding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We did some playing, Petra and me. And then, we did more playing. Playing is Petra and me’s favorite thing. Usually. Then we had dinner. And then it is now that we are writing it. So right now we are writing this thing. And it’s 9:25 so I need to go to bed. And dad keeps looking back and forth to his meeting. And Jonas is reading Petra books and I want to go over there in just a minute so I have a minute to finish this. Then we’ll probably go to bed in a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jessica:</p>



<p>I exercised, I worked, I went to mutual. I had fun. I went to bed.</p>



<p>(Jessica went to bed so quickly, I couldn’t get a better picture of her.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/djwR8eB9UoIcSgoxRsdXF-5U1UpwbyXaa3UAFH9mTxJSYP5pUKJ4fEUXLA9RVHEokAf0StXyigAjD81ILRkmGxcxRKphrG49PCSr6UkdNfg852Vp7U2NWkag6sFZa50w4Uh5WCBR" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Asher:</p>



<p>I had a dream that I solved the 3 by 3 rubik’s under 3 sec. and won a trip to the Bahamas and saw purple elephants that did the fortninte default dance and some did the floss then there were also pink giraffes that sang super smash bros song perfectly and there were also playing super smash bros and then I went into a yellow submarine with the Beatles and they were actual beetles. And then a pink blob destroyed the world. But the pink blob got destroyed by alien ships using nuclear weapons. And then I woke up and went to school and then I came home. And then I played a game. And that’s it. Except for I went to bed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lvRRO6vw3pSu-l4yhy-Nvh4WAq-qFJmlByfBgaxtl48JF3xiHsKByGyQJdj0xsvwZu14LyT_o2B25yCVYK2OA_LJRJGFsIViXVClzG4TQ2hVHGSxf6gkdbfB2Wk5vOZuToUePUm8" alt=""/></figure>



<p>January:</p>



<p>Woke up, 6:20. Went to seminary. Went back to sleep. And then I went to the Y to exercise. And then, I came home, had class (virtually), did homework, and did more homework, and I also, after that, I watched the Inauguration. The poetry girl was really good. She sounded good. She talked really well. And then I didn’t have work today. I went to mutual (virtually). And then I put ice cubes on my face because I have a headache. And I did drugs. And then I sat outside for ½ an hour. And then I played a game with some cute boys (Tac and Asher). And then I plan on going to sleep after this. Oh, also I swept the dining room. And I’m supposed to fold some laundry.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Wr9f5WT4iz1Klo5yEP2P8zT6XFuYVostCIhuXYR8w8Oqd03GnqbyNjRxvL11fbfiJ2mV7zenSHdoZJ4xZ6nkYJ7TWpElZmC40980hz4bz96JW7r-UeV6_9iPERHxKXe56v-KIsOB" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Ammon:</p>



<p>It so warms my heart to see my kids being so descriptive in their dictation of this day. They would have had more to say, had I not tried to get this all done after 9pm.</p>



<p>I awoke at 6am, to my and Jessica’s phone alarms. I promptly turned hers off and snoozed mine. Which is what I did when it went off again 10 minutes later. Finally at 6:20am I arose from my slumber and pulled myself out of bed. After a quick relief, I grabbed my laptop, Come, Follow Me manual, triple combination, phone and glasses and headed downstairs. I popped in on Jonas and gave him the 10 minute warning for seminary. I dropped all but my laptop on the living room couch and took my laptop into the family room to set up for seminary. Then I went to the basement to give January the 10 minute warning for seminary. I checked news or my BYU-I class for a few minutes, then gave January and Jonas the no minute warning for seminary. I studied scriptures (reading D&amp;C 5 and preparing a CFM lesson for tonight).&nbsp;</p>



<p>About 7am, Jessica and I started getting the other kids up by singing songs, and generally being parentally obnoxious (as all things are so early in the morning). Jessica focused on getting the girls ready and hair done (a long and frustrating process if girls are distracted and slow, which they were today). We had everyone in the family room and ready for family prayer by 7:38 or so, and ready for prayer 5 minutes later. Then we all piled into the suburban (January, myself, Jonas in the back, Petra, Anthea and Asher in the middle, Jessica driving and Tac riding shotgun). Discussion enroute (fussing, arguing, finding masks, being annoyed and frustrated) was brief and delightful. We made it to the elementary school, not last, but pretty close, and with a couple minutes to spare. After checking temps, answering no to all the questions, the three youngest were affectionately ejected from the vehicle to enjoy their day at school (just one of two each week). The rest of the family proceeded to the middle school to expunge the Tac in similar fashion. Decibels were much lower during this leg of the journey. Tac was summarily dismissed from the vehicle, and the remaining occupants proceeded to the local YMCA for an exuberant work out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Masks, temps, Nos said, we proceeded to wash hands then go up the YMCA stairs for a quick ab workout (crunches, crunches crunches, plank). Then on to the stationary bicycles where we had a gruelling personal live Peloton workout with Jessica instructing. Several series of hover then stand, cycling with resistance. It was sweaty but fulfilling and leg-strengthening. We left promptly after wiping down cycles and mats. I swung by the Library next door to pick up a book, but forgot it wasn’t open for curb-side pickup until 10am (it was 9:18am).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At home, I showered and prepared for work. It came slowly. Checking news (a nasty habit I have gotten myself into) and figuring out what I was going to do. I encouraged January to follow the family rule of no screens in bedrooms, and brought her from the basement to my room. Jessica went to the basement to work and coach (another reason for January to come upstairs). Jonas sat at downstairs on the couch for a while entertaining himself with educational and entertaining videos. I thusly worked for a few hours, on plans for workshops and events this coming semester. I kept peeking at the Inauguration events. I have never been interested nor cared to watch, but since it was streaming live to my computer, it’s been the easiest ever to partake. January was watching as required by her science class, so she could pick out any science related initiatives or policies that the new president would talk about in his address. I saw the actual swearing in, and that was about it. January enjoyed the recitation from Amanda Gorman, “The Hill We Climb”. I listened to it later. I also enjoyed it. We can be united despite, and because of, differences. Lunch was consumed, leftover potstickers and noodles. Meeting was had (just a check in with my supervisor about the coming semester). More work was done. I played with an Arduino kit for a bit. I tried to learn more about making a phone app. I walked in place for a good 40 minutes so I could get my goal of 10,000 steps every day this year. (Which I have done since I started on January 5. I usually have to spend an hour or so walking in place…)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oh, Tac came home from school on the bus around 12:48. At about 2:35 I stood up to take a break from work and realized I was supposed to go get Asher, Anthea and Petra from school. I got all ready and left, getting to the school about 2:45, not last, but pretty close. We stopped by the library to pick up my book on hold, Where Do We Go From Here by Martin Luther King, Jr. This is the last book he wrote before being assassinated a year later. Once we got home and settled, I went back to work on the Arduino and phone app. I worked until about 5:11pm.</p>



<p>Then it was a call to arms. Well, a call to do dinner chores and make dinner. All hands on deck! Asher set the table. Jonas put away clean dishes. Anthea took compost out (with help from me). All went smoothly, quickly, without complaint or frustration. Ha! I made rice bowl fixings (the rice I made yesterday), roasted sweet potatoes, red union, Jessica cut the cucumber and carrots (for the kids), feta cheese, craisins, crackers, spinach, cilantro lime dressing, cannellini beans. Yummy. Dinner was lively. Anthea didn’t want to sit where Asher placed her. Lots of yelling and crying. Finally, we got that settled. Dinner proceeded normally… loudly.</p>



<p>After dinner and a bit of clean up, Jessica went to Young Women’s meeting at the Church building, Tac went to his room for a Teachers Quorum zoom meeting, January went to her basement room for a zoom meeting with the older Young Women class, and Jonas and I went to my room for Priest Quorum zoom meeting. I was hoping Asher, Anthea and Petra would entertain themselves, but after 20 minutes of Anthea and Petra on Jonas and my lap as we watched a video about making knives, we sent them downstairs to watch a show. Asher worked on a 3D model of a submarine he is making with Tinkercad (and surely he watched a bunch of minecraft videos on YouTube, too). Priest Quorum went well. We watched a couple of videos on knife making. Learning the process, the tools, the type of metal. We also discussed the calendar of events and planned for our video we need to make for Stake Standards Night in February. We are covering Language from the For the Strength of Youth. We decided to have each of the boys come up with a scenario where they could use bad language, and some options to use instead. We’ll go to the high school to film this in two weeks. We’ll bleep out the “bad” language, and it should be funny.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all of our meetings and Jessica came home, I called us all in for family scripture and prayer. I got some garden tools and had us try and quote D&amp;C 4 (on Monday I gave the challenge that they get candy based on how much they can memorize by Sunday). We talked about what tools we can use to do missionary work. Then I started to take notes for this, but we decided to do prayer first, get kids ready for bed, and I would take them each one by one and write about their day. I started with Petra and followed the order as seen here. In the middle of Anthea’s dictation I remembered that I was supposed to have open office hours on zoom for my BYU-I class. I was 15 minutes late, and two people had logged in, but weren’t there any more. So I continued Antheas monologue. I got a quick note from Jonas, and a terse summary from Jessica as she headed to bed, exhausted from the days work. Tac gave a decent summary of the day. January and Ashere were less verbose. I had one student join the zoom meeting while Asher was typing up his dream. I was practicing guitar, but quickly took the “call” and answered the question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I finally made Tac and Asher go to bed a little after 10pm. Fortunately Anthea and Petra fell asleep somewhere between 9:30 and 10pm. January folded laundry and cleaned, then went to sleep around 10:20. I even outlasted Jonas writing up this monstrosity of a memoir of a single day. He went to bed between 10:30 and 10:45 (mostly because his internet shuts off, so nothing to do on his computer). And here I am, a minute to 11pm and finally finishing this overly lengthy journal article. To bed with me. And an end to this truly historic, unprecedented, COVID-19 corona virus pandemic, hybrid, virtual school, and Shepherd journaling day. Phew!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been reading several books lately that are encouraging me to use my time wisely and helping me realize I can accomplish whatever I want to do.</p>
<p>My wife is also starting up a life coaching business soon, <a href="http://jessicashepherd.coach">http://jessicashepherd.coach</a>, and all of this has got me thinking of ways for me to improve on a daily business.</p>
<p>For about a year now, I have been tracking things I want to do to improve. I have a journal that I write in nearly daily. At the beginning of each month, I decide on a few things that I want to focus on for the month, draw a little chart, and track those things each day.</p>

</p>
<p>Last month I came up with a nifty acronym to help me focus on things. At first I wanted it to be MOST, to make the MOST of each day, but I couldn&#8217;t think of anything for the &#8220;O&#8221;, so I came up with the next best thing; BEST, as in make the BEST of each day. Each letter stands for something to focus on each day.</p>
<p>B = brain. Do something to make you smarter.</p>
<p>E = exercise. Work your body.</p>
<p>S = spiritual. Do something to get closer to God.</p>
<p>T = talent. Do something to improve an existing talent or start learning a new one.</p>
<p>So this month, to make each day the BEST, I&#8217;m working on<a href="http://mossiso.com/2018/11/20/making-the-best-use-of-your-time.html/img_20181120_214430" rel="attachment wp-att-1734"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1734" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181120_214430-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181120_214430-300x215.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181120_214430-768x550.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181120_214430-1024x733.jpg 1024w, wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181120_214430-150x107.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181120_214430-624x447.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>B = brain: reading The Success Principles by Jack Canfield and Janet Switzer</p>
<p>E = exercise: give 100% when running, stretching, and 100 pushups program</p>
<p>S = spiritual: read from the <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2018/11?lang=eng">Ensign</a></p>
<p>T = talent: write a book. I have always wanted to write a sci-fi or fantasy book, so I am!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also see that I&#8217;m trying to be creative with lettering the month and year, and the design for filling in each days box, and miserably failing. Perhaps that will be a talent goal for a future month&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a teenager, my mom started taking note of everything the family did on January 20. It was just some random day, and some random idea to do as a fun thing for the family. Over the years we&#8217;ve kept that up as a family; sometimes more or less involved. A couple of years ago I decided to go all out and record as much of my day as possible. So here it is, my January 20, 2014:</p>
<p><b>12:01am-4:00am</b></p>
<p>Woke up a few times: potty, too much light, tossing, turning, etc.</p>
<p><b>4:00am-7:00am</b></p>
<p>Alarm went off at 4am. Hit snooze a couple of times, because, hey, it’s a holiday. Got up around 4:28am. Put on think, warm, wool socks and a long sleeve shirt. Went down stairs, one step at a time, like everyone else. Took my thyroid pill with some water. Prayed, read BoM (Alma chapter 43) and an article from January 2014 Ensign.</p>
<p>Then it was dissertating time. Dissertated until 7:18am. I didn’t feel like I got much done on the dissertation, and I didn’t. I started reading a dissertation written in 1984 in German about the same topic. I’ll use that as a good source for both parts of my dissertation (both parts being the history/narrative of the building project and associated concentration camps, and the second part what has happened in that community since the war, see http://nazitunnels.org for more info, and <a href="#appendix-a"><strong>APPENDIX A</strong></a> for the text of an upcoming grant application that succinctly outlines my dissertation in less than 1000 words-which this write up of the day will not be.)</p>
<p>Read a few other things here an there, tried to figure out how I’m going to get hours and hours of research and writing done with only two hours a day to do it in. Wrote down a really cool idea I have for an interactive map that shows the flight range of aircraft used in World War II. This would help with explaining the German need to move factories underground because the Allied bombers were reaching farther and farther into German territory (see <a href="#appendix-b"><strong>APPENDIX B</strong></a> for information on Grandpa Shepherd’s involvement in said bombing raids).</p>
<p>If I can pull that off, it would be part of my dissertation, making the argument for it being a digital history dissertation, and thereby hopefully not having to write as much, but will probably write over 200 pages anyhow, and closer to 250 pages, but way less than the average of 300 page history dissertations and nearly a third of the German history dissertations I’ve seen which go over 400+ pages because of extremely long, run on sentences like this one that are really popular in German academic writing and sometimes take up half a page with just one sentence.</p>
<p>I probably won’t do stuff like that in my dissertation, though.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 7am kids started waking up, going into my bedroom (where only Jessica lay sleeping, I was in the living room, not in the basement as usual, because it’s dark and cold down there. When the kids do wake up if I’m in the living room, I usually quickly turn off lights so they don’t know I’m down there and then quietly go into the basement to finish studying in peace and quiet, leaving the silly kids to my wonderful, very capable and caring spouse.)</p>
<p><b>7:00am-8:00am</b></p>
<p>So i was just getting into the reading and note taking for dissertation work, but I have scheduled myself to stop at 7am and do some exercising. I almost scrapped the normal routine, because, hey, it’s a holiday. But I knew I’d have to write a quick, short write up of the day today, and I wanted to write that I had exercised, so I went to the dungeon, er, basement to do my daily workout routine. Today was cardio-vascular (see <a href="#appendix-c"><strong>APPENDIX C</strong></a> for weekly work out schedule). That took a good 28 minutes and made me realize how old and out of shape I am. I took a shower and got ready for the day.</p>
<p><b>8:00am-10:00am</b></p>
<p>I’ll cut this one short. Ate breakfast with family and got all the kids ready for our service project. (see dear, I can be brief.) (addendum from the spouse: lots, and lots, and lots of whining and complaining from the leaches, I mean children.)</p>
<p><b>10:00am-12:00pm</b></p>
<p>Planned on leaving for service project by 10:10, 10:15 at the latest. Got in the car to much crying, fighting and complaining at 10:22. Sang “Happy, happy, cheerful, cheerful” to cut through the bickering and noise. Got most of us in a more smiley mood.</p>
<p>Had a great time being crafty at the service project. Saw a co-worker and another work-related-person there. Mostly helped Anthea color on herself and followed her around when she was done coloring. She apparently didn’t get enough food for breakfast and quickly ate the bag of pretzels that January brought. As she wandered around, she spied a container of sandwiches that some thoughtful mother had brought for her child. Anthea made a b-line for the table and grabbed a sandwich from the container, much to the chagrin of myself. The kind mother said it was OK if she had it (a sesame butter and banana on white hamburger bun sandwich), to which Anthea was much contented, and I was much grateful.</p>
<p>Our crafting being done about the noon-o-clock hour, and all of us much hungry, we headed home. Anthea fell asleep on the way, and stayed in that blessed condition for an hour after. The kids were all very awesome, by the way. There was no complaining, much helping and looking after each other, and participating with happy smiles and much craftiness. (see <a href="#appendix-d"><strong>APPENDIX D</strong></a>)</p>
<p><b>12:00pm-2:00pm</b></p>
<p>Got home and warmed up some leftovers for myself (it was pasta with pesto sauce and cherry tomatoes, quite tasty). Tac and Asher wanted nothing more than a bowl of cereal. Since Jessica wasn’t home, and I was too lazy to argue, I let them dine on crunchy wheat o’s and crunchy wheat squares with milk, because, hey, it’s a holiday. Who knows what Jonas ate. He must eat something because he keeps growing.</p>
<p>Anthea woke up around 1-ish, so I helped her eat something, can’t remember what (she loved dinner from last night, but wanted none of it today).</p>
<p>Teancum and Asher played and messed up the house while Jonas finished his tuba practicing, oh, I mean French horn. He also did an extra chore of vacuuming the upstairs so he could earn some computer time.</p>
<p>I talked Jessica into taking us all on her shopping trip, since it was rare we got to spend a Monday together. So we got all loaded into the car and were off by 2pm, except for Jonas who wanted to stay home, and January who was at a friends for lunch, bowling, and some fun at her house afterwards.</p>
<p><b>2:00pm-2:40pm</b></p>
<p>I put this time in for the benefit of specifying how long it took to get gas at Costco. It only takes 15 minutes to drive there. The remainder of the time in the above timeframe was spent in line for gas. I dropped Jessica off at the entrance to Costco so she could get started on gathering a heaping cartful of food. I was to get gas, go to Home Depot (literally across the street) to get replacement smoke detectors for our out of date units from the basement and kitchen area (yes, Mom, to replace the very one that woke you up for that one night with it’s incessant chirping, alerting us to the fact that, no, not the batteries need to be replaced, but the whole unit).</p>
<p>Anyhow, while in the near eternal line for gas, my bright and intelligent 6 year old questioned why we were going to a different store if Mom wanted to be with me so much. Great question, son. So skip going to HD by myself with three small children, and instead drive around the whole parking lot of Costco to find a spot (had to drive around because there were sooooo many people who’ve never seen snow before so they freak out and want to buy a million months worth of food for the one or two days that there will be snow &#8211; remember, Monday was our regular shopping day so we weren’t like all these other crazy people. That or it was a holiday so people were out shopping.) Found Jessica in the store, she was just about done. We only had a couple of good samples- chocolate covered granola bars of some kind… tasty.</p>
<p><b>2:40pm-4:40pm</b></p>
<p>I hate shopping, but when I’m with Jessica, even the most mundane and boring things are fun. I dare say, it&#8217;s a jolly holiday</p>
<p>With Jessica<br />
Jessica makes my &#8216;eart so light<br />
When the day is gray<br />
And ordinary<br />
Jessica makes the sun shine bright!</p>
<p>Oh &#8216;appiness is bloomin&#8217;<br />
All around &#8216;er<br />
The daffoldils are smilin&#8217;<br />
At the dove<br />
When Jessica &#8216;olds my &#8216;and<br />
I feel so grand<br />
My &#8216;eart starts beatin&#8217;<br />
Like a big brass band<br />
Oh, it&#8217;s a jolly holiday with Jessica<br />
No wonder that it&#8217;s Jessica that I love!</p>
<p>Costco, Home Depot, Walmart… Dang, that’s a lot of shopping. At Walmart, Teancum and Asher started going crazy with the broccoli. Tac hates broccoli, so Asher started chasing him around with it. They went a little overboard, so I had to take them out to the car. As we were waiting, Tac started bouncing around like he had red hot fire ants down his pants. I didn’t want to take both of those crazy kids into the store, and Tac had to go right then, so… quick stand at the side of the car, pee by the back wheel, cover up when people walk by… here’s a wet wipe to clean your hands, cause I can tell you need it, done. Now just wait for Jessica. Dang, now Asher needs to go too. Well, I’ll get you out, but just wait, Mom should be done any second now, so just wait… oh, got your pants down around your ankles already, well, OK just pee behind the car then. Like seriously, 10 minutes later Jessica is finally done. Apparently that lady on the checkout lane won’t be winning any speed contests, but I hear there are a couple of snails in the park that are looking for a date.</p>
<p>And back home again, exactly 2 hours and 40 minutes after we left. I timed it.</p>
<p><b>5:00pm-8:00pm</b></p>
<p>Let’s just skip the twenty minutes between 4:40 and 5pm, shall we.</p>
<p>Made some yummy stir-fry for dinner. Thought I was just about as good as Dad with my cooking skills. I really appreciate his making dinner all the time, and some how it rubbed off on me and I love to cook, too. I added something Dad would probably never have done, though (which is odd considering he loved okra and I remember having cow tongue and liver), and that was tofu!</p>
<p>Kids always complain about dinner… don’t want it, don’t like it. Have you tried it? No, don’t want to. Well try it first. Oh, hey, this is pretty good. I do like green eggs and ham, thank you, thank you Sam-I-am. Had to start dinner without Jessica because she didn’t get enough shopping out of her system and she was at Target looking for things to trade money for.</p>
<p>Let’s just say that after dinner is usually pretty crazy, and today was worse. Plus we tried to have Family Home Evening. I sang “Geneology, I am doing it” while Jessica played and sang “Family History, I am doing it.” Only the second verses are the same on that one. I explained that doing our family history includes writing in our journals, or writing down what happened to us today, and how my family started this fun tradition to write down what happened on January 20, just for fun. Our FHE was to write down what we did today. You have read the paltry attempts at historical narrative from everyone else, now your eyes bleed with amazement and your brain bulges with incomprehension as you graze upon the writings of this budding pleonastic historian. I encouraged all to write with this witty turn of prose: If you don’t write about what you did, then you don’t exist for today.</p>
<p>FHE was mostly exasperating. Let’s just say my temper during FHE was inversely proportional to the hyper activity, and leave it at that. Scriptures was two verses, and prayer was two sentences…</p>
<p>Getting kids to bed went well. I seem to be able to handle the insanity of the hour much better than in years past.</p>
<p>I sang “Der Kuckuk und der Esel” (see <a href="#appendix-e"><strong>APPENDIX E</strong></a>) to Anthea and put her to bed. I brushed Asher and Teancum’s teeth and read them a couple of Dr. Seuss books.</p>
<p><b>8:00pm-11pm</b></p>
<p>I wrote this.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<h2><a name="appendix-a"></a>APPENDIX A</h2>
<p align="center"><b>Nazi Tunnels: Underground Factory Dispersal and Forced Labor Camps At Porta Westfalica</b></p>
<p>Sitting atop the Wittekindsberg hill south of Minden, Germany nestled against the town of Barkhausen, is a massive monument to a massive historical figure of nineteenth-century Germany. Built from 1892-1896 is a large bronze statue of William I within a gazebo made from sandstone taken from the very hill upon which it rests. Dedicated to the memory of <i>Wilhelm dem Grossen</i>, this monument stands for some today as a symbol of German unity. Buried underneath this monument are remnants of a more discordant German past.</p>
<p>Mining during the nineteenth century left large, open mines in Wittekindsberg and Jakobsberg hills, on the opposite banks of the Weser River from each other. These tunnel systems went virtually unused throughout the early twentieth century, but found use again in the final years of World War II, as Nazi leaders made concerted efforts to protect the increasingly targeted aircraft factories by relocating them to physically separate locations, and in some cases into underground facilities. Forced laborers from nearby concentration camps supplied the labor. One such project was located in the unused mines in Porta Westfalica’s hills, with inmates supplied from the Neuengamme Concentration Camp near Hamburg and prisoners of war from Russia and Poland. Stone once used to commemorate and memorialize the unification of fragmented German kingdoms was now discarded in favor of the underground space, just as the lives and humanity of inmates was discarded for the labor they could provide. Such projects were at the heart of Nazi desires to eradicate through work anybody they felt undeserving of life.</p>
<p>This dissertation describes the use of forced labor to convert existing mines and tunnel systems in Wittekindsberg and Jakobsberg into industrial spaces, outlines the plans to use the tunnels as underground dispersal locations, and explores the post-war history of the tunnels ending with present day issues surrounding memory and appropriate ways to deal with the physical remains of the tunnel systems and labor camps.</p>
<p>This work is unique in several ways. First, nearly all scholarly narratives about the nearly 30 underground dispersal projects throughout Germany are written in German, French, Danish or Czech. To date, there are only two publications written in English that are dedicated to the history of an underground dispersal project and associated labor camps. This work will present the first English scholarship of the tunnels and camps at Porta Westfalica.</p>
<p>A second unique aspect is the timeframe to be studied. Most works on underground dispersal projects narrate only the few years surrounding the tunnel and labor camp existence, ending with liberation by Allied forces. This work will extend the conventional timeline by researching the post-war history of the tunnels. The presence of these tunnel projects has had lasting effect on the local community. Not only is the landscape often physically altered, but the collective memory of the local citizens must also bear witness of the atrocities perpetrated against inmates. Local citizens tell stories about who, what and why concentration camps were located in their neighborhoods; this also becomes part of the history of the underground project. While this work does not seek to “dredge up dirty laundry” about individuals involved, it does seek to highlight the perpetual issues of memory and commemoration that German citizens must face since the end of World War II.</p>
<p>Finally, the use of new media will bring this work into the realm of digital humanities by presenting the research materials and the scholarly writing process in the public sphere through the use of an online archive and scholarly website, and by creating 3D representations and geographical maps of the tunnel systems and their geo-spatial relationships with the concentration camps. This work will present a unique aspect of the history of the underground dispersal projects by utilizing new ways of visualizing and presenting data and sources, and implementing research methods from other disciplines such as the computer sciences and geography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A two-day visit to Porta Westfalica was made in July 2013 as part of a research trip funded by the Dr. Richard M. Hunt Fellowship from the American Council on Germany. While there, I met with Dr. Gerhard Franke, the local heritage curator for Porta Westfalica. He showed me several former labor camp and tunnel locations, and had the local newspaper conduct an interview that resulted in a short article about my visit. In Hannover, I met with Dr. Rainer Fröbe, a German historian who has done extensive research on this topic.</p>
<p>The CEHS Research and Travel Grant will provide for two weeks in Porta Westfalica with three important research goals: visit with survivors, current and past city officials, citizens and historians; visit archives and digitize documents; and photograph the tunnels and former labor camps. Unfortunately for my previous trip, I was unaware of the existence of the Concentration Camp Memorial and Documentation Center of Porta Westfalica, headed by Babette Lissner. This group has connections to many citizens and city officials who were involved with the tunnels and former labor camps since the war, and those who were instrumental in the creation of a memorial to the laborers. They also have documents pertaining to the city’s immediate post-war dealings with the tunnels. At least one trip to Hannover to work with Dr. Rainer Fröbe is also planned. The grant will also fund the digitization of documents pertaining to the immediate post-war decisions made about the tunnels, as well as documents listing camp inmates who died and where they were buried. Access to the city’s newspaper archives will provide an understanding of the social issues the town has faced and how they were dealt with in the public sphere. A final goal will be to photograph the tunnels, former labor camp locations, cemeteries, and obtain GPS coordinates for each location.</p>

<p>I got this book from the co-author and wife of the pilot for Grandpa Shepherd’s B-17. She lives only a few miles away from us and found me through a post I wrote on my blog about Dad’s funeral. Here’s a link to the book and website: <a href="http://www.ww2pilot.com/">http://www.ww2pilot.com/</a> There is not a whole lot about Grandpa specifically. His plane was called the Blue Hen Chick.

<p>I have sung this song, in German, to each of the kids when they are very young. Some have begged and begged for it, refusing to go to sleep until they hear it over and over again, causing me to record it to a CD which can be played on repeat until the silly child is asleep; and then, from one night to the next, they are sick of it and don’t want it anymore. Anyhow, I love to sing it to each of the kids while they are babies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My dad passed away two years ago today. I was recently in Arizona, but didn&#8217;t visit his grave site. This is what I wrote to my family about that.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1508" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BeforeDadShaved-06-19-1997.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1508 " alt="Dad as I knew him growing up." src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BeforeDadShaved-06-19-1997-300x215.jpg" width="300" height="215" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BeforeDadShaved-06-19-1997-300x215.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BeforeDadShaved-06-19-1997-1024x734.jpg 1024w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BeforeDadShaved-06-19-1997-250x179.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BeforeDadShaved-06-19-1997-150x107.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BeforeDadShaved-06-19-1997-624x447.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BeforeDadShaved-06-19-1997.jpg 1943w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1508" class="wp-caption-text">Dad as I knew him growing up.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>It was great to be in Arizona at the end of June and July. I had really wanted to visit Dad&#8217;s grave while I was there. I even got up early the day after I got back from Germany to run over there, like literally run over there, but I only made it to Longmore and 8th Street (now for some dumb reason renamed Rio Solado Pwky). I never did make it to the cemetery, though. This made me a bit sad, like I wasn&#8217;t honoring Dad, or remembering him appropriately.</p>
<p>But then I thought, you know, Dad&#8217;s body is the only thing over there, and it&#8217;s only been there for 2 years. Dad really isn&#8217;t there, he&#8217;s at home, where he lived for nearly (or over?) 40 years of his life. Then I started seeing how I remembered and honored him when I was there, at home, for a few short days. I honored Dad when I fixed the toilet and changed the light bulb in the ceiling fan in Mom and Dad&#8217;s room. Dad always fixed up the house, was always doing repairs. I paused for a moment and looked at his dresser. Much cleaner now than before. But I loved the mystery that was always Dad&#8217;s dresser. I just knew there were interesting and exciting things to find in there… as well as $300 in quarters.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1509" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/P1000351.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1509 " alt="Dad loved fishing, and he loved taking his grandkids fishing." src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/P1000351-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/P1000351-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/P1000351-1024x768.jpg 1024w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/P1000351-250x187.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/P1000351-150x112.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/P1000351-624x468.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1509" class="wp-caption-text">Dad loved fishing, and he loved taking his grandkids fishing.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I remembered Dad when I sat at the computer desk to do some emails. Dad sure did love solitaire. Which also reminded me of pre-computer times when Dad taught us how to play solitaire with cards. He used to do that a lot when I was young.</p>
<p>I remembered Dad when I would read books to my kids, on the trip to AZ and since. Dad read us the Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and more (even though I fell asleep all the time, which is probably the original goal anyways).</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1510" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1510" style="width: 244px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-29-15.24.04.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1510" alt="My kids at the Kids Club House" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-29-15.24.04-244x300.jpg" width="244" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-29-15.24.04-244x300.jpg 244w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-29-15.24.04-250x306.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-29-15.24.04-122x150.jpg 122w, wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013-07-29-15.24.04.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1510" class="wp-caption-text">My kids at the Kids Club House</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I remembered Dad every time I went into the back yard. He planted all of those trees (well, Aaron and I planted the big Ash tree, if I remember right). But he was a good landscaper designer. He put those sheds in the back yard to hold all of his tools. I remember how good he was at making, fixing, and repairing things. I like to think he knew enough to put an AC unit out there so that Mom would be able to turn it into the Kids Club House (or the Black Light District, as I like to call it).</p>
<p>I made pancakes one morning, and that reminded me of Dad, too. They were plain, no ham or corn in them. Dad loved to cook, so I remember Dad every time I cook.</p>
<p>So, it doesn&#8217;t matter that I didn&#8217;t go to the cemetery, because Dad&#8217;s not really there. He&#8217;s at home with Mom, right where he always is.</p>
<p>You are the best family ever. I am so thankful we are eternal.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Ammon</p>

<p>My dad passed away kind of unexpectedly a few weeks ago. He was diagnosed with liver cancer (although he never drank a drop of alcohol) about two years ago. At that time he was given a year or two to live. For the past year or so, he was in and out of the hospital for treatments and other health issues. We thought his last trip to the hospital was just another one of those in and out visits. He got <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001858/">cellulitis</a>in July, and that severely dehidrated his body, which</p>
<p>started to shut down his kidneys. By the beginning of August he was in the hospital again, and there was nothing they could do for him. All of his seven children and their families came back to Mesa, Arizona as quickly as we could. Unfortunately, my dad passed away the night before I got there. When I learned that he died, it was the first time I had really cried since I was a kid.</p>
<p>The funeral and everything went very well. The friends from my parents Ward were awesome and supplied us with ample and very yummy food, so that we didn&#8217;t have to worry about feeding the 28 or so people that were always at my parents house. I was asked to give the life sketch of my dad at the funeral. It was not all inclusive, or even all that detailed, but it expresses what my dad was: a simple, humble, loving father and husband, who tried to do what was right.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the life sketch:</p>
<p><strong>Life Sketch of Carl Edwin Shepherd</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dad was born April 30, 1949 in Mesa, Arizona, to Max and Lois Shepherd.</p>
<p>He received his Eagle Scout award, graduated from Mesa High School, and served a mission to Southern Germany. His life “took a major change” after meeting a girl at a Church dance. After the first date he was “hooked for life”. Ed and Cathy were married on February 16<sup>th</sup>, 1973.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He died August 8, 2011, in Mesa, Arizona. His father and a younger brother preceded him in death, and he left behind his mother, his wife, seven children and fourteen grandchildren.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In between those dates and events the world was forever changed by the life and love of the great man we honor and remember today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Life Protected</strong></p>
<p>My Dad’s life was protected, even from his earliest days. When he was still a baby, he was in his crib for a nap. His mother was visiting with a neighbor, when she felt the distinct impression to go check on him. She followed the impression and when she went to the crib, my dad’s head was wedged between the crib and mattress, and was already nearly strangled.</p>
<p>When two years old, he was putting on his sandals, and was bit by a scorpion. He was in convulsions by the time he got to the hospital, but was able to get treated and was only sick for several days.</p>
<p>Dad was protected in other ways as well. He had many experiences that helped him learn the truth and power of God, and the plan He had for my Dad. Once as boy, he was tempted to drink alcohol when he found a bottle of liquor on his way home from school. He purchased a Slurpee from the store, poured the liquor in and was about to take a drink when the cup flew from his hand. He felt impressed that if he ever took a drink he would never be able to put it down. This experience helped him live the Word of Wisdom through out his life.</p>
<p>As it says in D&amp;C 89: 21, “And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.” On Dec 17, 1988, Dad’s arm got stuck in a lathe at work, and broke in four places above the elbow. “The Lord was watching over me that day,” he wrote in his journal, “because it would have been so easy for the lathe to have ripped my arm clear off or done far more damage than it did.”  Dad’s brother Paul, who worked at the same shop, remarked on how much of a miracle it was. The only way the machine would stop was for someone to push the off button. With Dad stuck in the lathe there was no time and he was in no position to have done it, but the machine stopped before any more damage could be done. The Lord was definitely there to help out. Charity recalled that it was a blessing in disguise for Dad to be home so much to help take care of Charity and get to know her better. Shortly after the accident, his father Max Shepherd, blessed him that he would “heal quicker than normal and that this would be a testament to his family because he had never used drugs, alcohol, tobacco and had kept his body clean.” Indeed, this was a testimony to his family. The destroying angel had passed him by on this and many other occasions. Even though Dad died of ill health, it was not the destroying angel that came to take him away but it was an angel of compassion and love.</p>

<p><strong>Worthy Priesthood Holder</strong></p>

Asher shares his grandpa&#39;s birthday.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Dad emulated scriptures in many ways. My Dad was a humble servant and worthy priesthood holder, and surely one of the chosen of God. One of the great scriptures detailing the rights and responsibilities of the priesthood is found in D&amp;C 121: 40-44. “Hence many are called, but few are chosen. No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile—Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.” Of course I never needed reproving, but my siblings tell me this was my Dad’s way. J  Rarely would he yell, and then usually at the situation and not the individual. Ben remembers many times where Dad exemplified this eternal priesthood pattern, especially after Ben learned that our suburban was not only good for carrying people but for mud bogging, jumping out of retention basins, and all manner of shenanigans. After one such occasion the car would not start. My Dad found the problem, then asked Ben to come out to the car. Instead of yelling or getting mad, my Dad showed Ben how to clean the mud from the starter and get the car working again. He ended with his expression of love for Ben. Such was the pattern over and over again. Dad was quick with reprove, by story or explanation, and followed up with a show of love.</p>
<p>When Aaron was pre-school aged, he found a drill in the back yard that Dad had borrowed from our Grandpa. He started drilling holes in the dirt. After a few minutes Dad came out, asked him to stop, then went back inside. After he left, Aaron promptly forgot, and started drilling again. Dad came out and again asked him to stop. As soon as Dad went back inside, Aaron started drilling again. For the third time Dad came out. Aaron knew he was in trouble and expected it. Dad patiently picked up Aaron, brought him into the living room and sat him on the couch. He told Aaron he loved him, and then went back to what he was doing.</p>
<p>Dad reproved with sharpness at times, but always let us know that he loved us, and we know undeniably that his faithfulness is stronger than death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dad loved serving in the Church. He had many callings, but the ones he wrote most of were the ones where he got to serve others the most, such as being a Stake Missionary, a Teachers Quorum Advisor while my brother Aaron and I were Teachers, and the Stake calling to be in charge of our building. I have many fond memories of helping him get the Stake Center satellite and recording equipment ready for General Conference. Two special times were right before my mission and right after. I could tell my Dad honored and sustained the Prophet and Apostles by his dedicated service in the Church. He taught all of us boys the “right way” to help with chairs at any Church function. 10 in a row, all facing the same way, evenly stacked on each side of the cultural hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dad’s love</strong></p>
<p>Dad showed us love in so many ways. In a letter he wrote to Ben after his mission, he expressed the need for people to be shown love in different ways. “Consider the needs of each child separately, for just as adults are different, each child is different also. Each must be treated different. There are huggers and tell me but touch me nots. Some will learn from a lecture or a story, others need a more physical approach. Each needs to know that you truly love them for who they are, children of God on loan to two other children who have a few more minutes of experience.”</p>
<p>Even after getting up really early, and doing demanding physical work during the day, Dad would sing us to bed, or read us stories like the Hobbit and the Lord of the Ring trilogy.</p>
<p>Dad was so excited when Charity made the Cheerleading team. “Great!” he said, “I get to go to all the football games… to see you of course.”</p>
<p>Dad was always building stuff for us: a big fort in the back yard (he kept it a surprise by telling us it was a show case for his prize elk rack). He built a loft bed for our room (this was especially memorable for me, I even cried the day the family took it out). He built a couch to store our year supply, and an entertainment center out of a piano crate. He built rocking horses, and wooden guns.</p>
<p>Dad would make dinner everyday while Mom was giving piano lessons, and he would open the car door for Mom. On the occasions when he was home for breakfast, he would make pancakes or waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. These examples have become natural for his own sons, as they emulate his good example of service and love to his family.</p>
<p>More recently, when we would visit for Christmas, if ever we mentioned we needed something (like baby food), the next day there would be a month supply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remembrances</strong></p>
<p>We’ll always remember you Dad. Your collection of suspenders. Your garden and other yard projects. Your collecting quarters. Trips to the desert for picnics and shooting guns, and your amazing knowledge of plant life, wildlife and geology. The vast amounts of seemingly trivial trivia. If only we could have convinced you to be on Jeopardy, Ken Jennings would have met his match. We’ll miss your wonderful tenor singing. We’ll miss your cooking. Most of all we’ll miss your love and companionship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is but a sad temporary parting, for our hope in eternal life and the beautiful plan of salvation made possible by our loving and merciful Savoir, allows us to hope for a better day, when we will all be reunited and have eternal life with God our Father and His Son Jesus Christ, whom we can all seek to emulate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently did the 130 miles on Skyline Drive. This was the third year in a row to do this ride. It was lots of fun, and lots of pain. I purchased a brand new cyclo-cross bike and got it the day before the ride. That was a bad mistake. Take a bike that you&#8217;ve been on a few times&#8230;</p>
<p>I had a few troubles with the brakes and front derailleur, but all in all it was a great trip. We stayed overnight in Waynesboro.</p>
<p>We went 66.8 miles on Friday, from Hawkes Bill Gap to Waynesboro, and 65.3 back the next day, for a total of 132.1 miles. I averaged about 6 or 7 miles an hour, and as you can see from the elevation profile, that was usually the speed up the hills. I got up to 40 miles/hour on one of the down hills.</p>
<p>Highlights of the trip: much nicer bike to ride than previous years, seeing a bear, turkey, and deer, speaking German to a couple from Germany, being interviewed by a news lady (someone had driven off the side of a cliff on Skyline Drive the day before), surviving 130 miles!</p>
<p>I was definitely worn out by the end of the ride. I&#8217;ll have to be in much better shape next year.</p>
<p>Thanks to Don and Taylor, two good buddies for making the trip possible.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve already been out on a quick 14 mile ride (in only one hour).<br />
