To prepare for these types of questions I wrote down (actually, I typed them all in, no pencil or paper used \ud83d\ude42 ) the three nations I&#8217;m looking at and some themes, events, and books I would like to use in a course. I struggled with which people, if any to focus on.<\/p>\n<p>A theoretical question I could be asked is: Say you have to teach a course on (Modern England, Modern France, Modern Germany, Modern Europe, World Wars in Europe, etc). What themes, events, people would you focus on and what books would you include? What would be the layout of the course?<\/p>\n<p>I focus on individual countries below, and for a general European course, I would just draw from each of the countries. The books I pull from are only the ones on my Orals reading list. I would most likely supplement with other books after doing some research if I were really teaching a course.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that I probably would never just go chronologically through a time period to hit big events and &#8220;important&#8221; people. History is very subjective. We look back on events and information with a certain set of &#8220;filters&#8221; on. For example we view Germany with political filters, focusing on governments and politicians. Or we may focus on France with cultural filters, looking at food, society, entertainment and arts. It&#8217;s impossible to get a <em>full<\/em> picture or sense of the past. Just as it&#8217;s impossible to gain a full sense of the present. There&#8217;s just too many people, too many viewpoints, too many sides to the same story, and too many filters to encompass everything. What&#8217;s the point, then? The point is to do what we can. Find what interests you and study the past through that filter. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with learning about one slice of the pie, as long as we don&#8217;t think our slice represents the whole thing. With that said, then, I would probably pick a few themes and have the books, discussions and (unless totally unavoidable) lectures focus on those themes. See the very bottom of this post for a couple of teaching ideas.<\/p>\n<h2>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_833\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-833\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/TrafalgarSquare-England.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-833\" title=\"Trafalgar Square, London, England. 1915\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/TrafalgarSquare-England-300x283.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/TrafalgarSquare-England-300x283.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/TrafalgarSquare-England-250x236.jpg 250w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/TrafalgarSquare-England-150x141.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/TrafalgarSquare-England.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trafalgar Square, London, England. 1915<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/h2>\n<h2>England<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Themes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Industrial Revolution (political and economic changes), gender  issues, education and society (state vs individual), nationalism,  modernization, imperialism<\/p>\n<p><strong>Events:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Industrial Revolution<\/p>\n<p>Chartists<\/p>\n<p>Imperialism (changes)<\/p>\n<p>Boer Wars<\/p>\n<p>WWI &#8211; inter war &#8211; WWII<\/p>\n<p>post-WWII<\/p>\n<p><strong>People:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Books:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thompson, E.

It would be fun to divide the class into sections, and  each group take a specific &#8220;filter&#8221; (gender, culture, politics, economy,  class, race, etc). Each group either gets their own reading list or  they have to pull the specific themes from a general list. Then each  class period, each group takes a turn discussing history viewed through  their filter. Have the other groups not presenting write one question  before class and one question after for the presenting group to answer  about their &#8220;filter.&#8221; (Questions could be done on a blog.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Timelines<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have students make a timeline of the time period the class will be    studying. Then in the first lecture share what my points are and argue    them. Have the students keep their timeline throughout the semester.    They will argue their points, especially if they change them, taking    ideas from the texts. Final paper is a well argued timeline.<\/p>\n<p>(PS.
