Content<\/h3>\n<p>You may want to start out with a cool design, or fun idea on how to interact with visitors, or what have you. But really, the most important thing a website has going for it is the content. Design is a close second (but we&#8217;ll talk about that last), because people tend to shy away from &#8220;ugly&#8221; sites. But they won&#8217;t even go in the first place if the content isn&#8217;t relevant.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to ask yourself a few questions to get an idea of what kind of website you need. The answers will even help define the design, and determine the platform, or website technology, that you use.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What information do you want to share?<\/li>\n<li>Why do you want to make a website?<\/li>\n<li>Do you want conversations to take place on your website?<\/li>\n<li>Do you want a blog, a simple website with information about you or a topic, or something else?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Domain Name<\/h3>\n<p>All computers on the Internet or World Wide Web have a unique number associated with them, called an IP (Internet Protocol) Address. Kind of like a Social Security Number. In order to get data from a server (a computer that &#8220;serves&#8221; content, either data, websites, videos, pictures, etc), you would need to type in the specific number into your web browser. IP Addresses are in the format XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX. If you connect to the Internet at home, you might see your laptop get an IP Address like 192.168.1.20.<\/p>\n<p>Since humans remember letters and words better than numbers, there is a system set up to translate words into the IP Address for a server. It is kind of like the old fashioned telephone directory. You can remember the telephone number to a person&#8217;s house, or look up the person in the phone directory to get their number. This also allows for multiple names to be pointed at one IP Address, like multiple people living in one\u00a0 house, sharing a phone number.<\/p>\n<p>This set of characters or words is called a domain name. A domain name allows for an almost unlimited number of unique identifiers to point to a limited number of IP Addresses. The domain name plays an important role in search engine rankings. If this is your personal site, try to get your name, or part of it, as the domain name. It can be all you need for &#8220;brand&#8221; identification.<\/p>\n<p>Shop around before you buy a domain name. There are plenty of options out there, just do a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=domain+registra\">search for domain registrar<\/a>. Often a hosting provider will sell domain names as well. As of this writing, you should be able to get a domain name for around $10-$11 a year. Make sure the registrar includes DNS management.<\/p>\n<p>.org, .net, .com, .info, .us, &#8230; What type of domain name should you buy? There are 19 top level domains (TLDs the very last part of a domain name, the part followed by the last period), and over 250 country code top-level domains (.us, .me, .de, .uk, etc.) That depends on a few things, the most important being, which one is available. Generally, .com and .org are the most sought after. Here is a list of the top-level domains and their intended purposes (from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains\">Wikipedia<\/a>).<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td><a title=\".com\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/.com\">.com<\/a><\/td>\n<td>commercial<\/td>\n<td>This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register.
