It most often encompasses  development and use of mechanical technology, a change in gender roles,  a real or perceived rise in standard of living, adjustments in social  classes, and, often, political change. Modernization at times was seen  in different ways including: a detriment to human society, a marvelous  improvement to society, an effect of economic and political challenges,  and, most recently, as an inevitable evolution of progress.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_782\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-782\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/758px-1831-View-Whitechapel-Road-steam-carriage-caricature.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-782\" title=\"758px-1831-View-Whitechapel-Road-steam-carriage-caricature\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/758px-1831-View-Whitechapel-Road-steam-carriage-caricature-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-782\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Steam Carriages as the vehicles of the future.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Modernism in England can be seen in all these ways in the nineteenth  century. The Industrial Revolution, as pointed out by E. P. Thompson had  a great impact on the social and economic status of the poor as whole  industries turned to machines in factories and entire occupations (think  weavers) were discontinued. Formation of factory unions lead to a  politically emboldened populace. The Victorian period is known for the  ideals of separate spheres for men (political, public, and occupational)  and women (private, nurturing) that are still observed and discussed  and contested to this day. As Robert Wohl writes, these Victorian ideals  are what caused many young individuals (in England, France and Germany)  during the turn of the century to question the role of authority and  the place of such ideals. English technological modernism during the  19th century was hampered by the desire of the business classes to  emulate the aristocracy. Martin Wiener writes that this English  pastoralism affected the economy by not allowing it to grow as in other  countries. Another form of modernist government was seen in England as  Parliament enacted many laws that directly interfered with individuals.  Laws governing the poor, woman&#8217;s rights, education, and voting abilities  all showed, for better or worse, a government with more interest in  their citizens.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_214\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-214\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-214\" title=\"Horton 2-29\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-4-300x143.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-4-300x143.png 300w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-4-250x119.png 250w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-4-150x71.png 150w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-4.png 409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-214\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Reconstructed Horton 2-29<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>If modernization is characterized primarily by use of technology,  especially of an industrial revolution, then Germany got off to a late  start comparatively. But following the unification and  industrialization in late 19th Century, Germany showed great progress.  Advances in aviation with Zeppelin, in art with the Bauhaus movement are  just two of the many examples. Politically Germany changed from a group  of loosely connected principalities to become a federated nation with,  albeit very weak, parliamentary government. At the turn of the century,  German youth were struggling with the sense of modernism and formed many  youth groups to express concern with political and social issues.  Germany showed a peculiar sense of modernization during the Third Reich.  Whereas Nazi ideology extolled the life of the peasant, the simple life  of the Volk, seemingly anti-modern, they still exhibited very modern  practices. The building of the Autobahns, the development of the first  ballistic missile, the successful flights of the first jet powered  aircraft were all seemingly contradictory to basic Nazi ideology.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_800\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-800\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0503-0015-001_Sachsenring_Trabant_601.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-800\" title=\"Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0503-0015-001,_Sachsenring_Trabant_601\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-B0503-0015-001_Sachsenring_Trabant_601-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-800\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">East German Trabant, 1963<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>During  the bifurcation years, West Germany enjoyed the status of a  technologically advanced and modern country. East Germany suffered the  stigma of a backwards and inept Soviet satellite country, incapable of  keeping up with modern technologies. Stokes shows, though, that East  Germany maintained technical competence through the length of its  existence (longer than the Third Reich, Weimar Republic and Imperialism,  a testament to a successful country with successful technologies such  as the Trabant, optics, and computers. What didn&#8217;t work in East Germany  was the political desire to keep up with western technology, but the  ineptness at maintaining a supportive economy, due in part to Soviet  inability or unwillingness to support East German technologies. East  Germany, in effect, sought to specialize in the fringe technologies of  the west, but did not have the underlying infrastructure to support  them.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_801\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-801\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/220px-Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-801\" title=\"220px-Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/220px-Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">French Nuclear Power Plant at Cattenom<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Modernization in the political sense has been attributed to  the French Revolution. Changes between monarchies (and empires) to  republics throughout the early 19th century sparked the social and  political movements in Europe towards self-governed people (something  which the nobility and educated classes thought undesirable and  potentially devastating). As the Second Empire moved into the Third  Republic, self-government began in earnest, as national governments  allowed local governments more control. National governments also became  more interested in the individual citizens, much the same as in  England, as they enacted laws restricting religion and regulating  education. As always a factor, the Dreyfus Affair showed a nation  struggling with the society and the ideals that came out of political  change. Continual losses (Franco-Prussian, WWI and WWII) to Germany and  colonial troubles led France to desperately look towards modern  technology, such as nuclear power, to regain international standing, and  create a positive national narrative.<\/p>\n<h4>Works Cited:<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Raymond G Stokes, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Constructing Socialism: Technology and Change in East Germany 1945-1990<\/span> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000). <span class=\"Z3988\" title=\"url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=urn%3Aisbn%3A0801863910&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.btitle=Constructing%20Socialism%3A%20Technology%20and%20Change%20in%20East%20Germany%201945-1990&amp;rft.place=Baltimore&amp;rft.publisher=Johns%20Hopkins%20University%20Press&amp;rft.aufirst=Raymond%20G&amp;rft.aulast=Stokes&amp;rft.au=Raymond%20G%20Stokes&amp;rft.date=2000&amp;rft.isbn=0801863910\"> <\/span><\/li>\n<li>E.
