This project uses a plot graph to display numerical data along with historical events. Sort of a mix between numbers and dates. Analytic history, if you will. I love the simplicity of the look, the ease of use, and the way it merges cold, dead data with live historical events.

This is an awesome tool to allow that to happen.<\/p>\n<p>The other project, <a href=\"http:\/\/simile.mit.edu\/exhibit\/\">Exhibit<\/a>, is a digital historians dream. Do you have lots of spreadsheets of info, perhaps all your dissertation data stored in the old JSON file? Wondering how to show that on the web without creating an extensive database solution?  Exhibit takes care of it for you. And it&#8217;s dynamic! Sort and search the data automatically included. Crazy goodness!
