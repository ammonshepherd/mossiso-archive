While thinking about projects to do for my history and maps class this semester, and while talking with a colleague, I wondered how one could graphically represent ones genealogy.  Most of us in the United States have ancestors that came from somewhere else. Many of us have ancestors that came from multiple somewhere elses. Looking at my ancestry alone I claim Arizona, Colorado, Utah, England, Sweeden, Germany and I&#8217;m sure several other places I don&#8217;t yet know of. One thought as to how to do this would be with a world map and lines and dots representing locations and familial connections.  The lines and dots would be in gradients of color, each color representing a date. I tried doing a mock up in Photoshop quickly, but it wasn&#8217;t working right. I&#8217;ll have to do it in Flash, since that behaves like I expect.  Flash might be a better platform anyways, because the map is then dynamic and can be dragged, zoomed, and dots and lines can be given data associated with them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have this thought, and it was brought to mind again by an article on Wired which linked to this artists (Jason Salavon) work with the US census data.
