How often do we try to ask God for things, but He can&#8217;t answer or look at us because we have chosen to be disobedient. He gives us commandments and consequences and He MUST abide by them. If He breaks them even once, even the smallest one, He would cease to be God.\u00a0 He can not be the law giver and enforcer and break His own laws. I think I felt a bit of the heart ache He feels when He is bound to His laws and can not help because we have not kept our part of the bargain.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, He is a merciful God and we can rectify our standing with Him when we apply the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Through repentance, continued obedience, and the cleansing power of the Atonement, we can have again a clean and pure relationship with our Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[From my journal on\u00a0 November 26, 2007] Jan was having a hard time staying in bed tonight.
