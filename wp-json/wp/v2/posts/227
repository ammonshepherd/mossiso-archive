I expressed this feeling to the boys, too.<\/p>\n<p>I said to the boys, &#8220;Do you want to know what the key is to be a God?&#8221; They of course did. I told them it was written on the board. I told them to look at Christ&#8217;s life. For whom did he do every single thing that he did in life? It was for others. All of the miracles, the healing, the feedings, the teachings, were for the benefit of others. Only one time is it recorded what his desires were. That was in the Garden of Gethsemane, as he was to atone for the sins of all people. He said, if it be at all possible, I don&#8217;t want to do this, BUT I will do what somebody else wants me to, I&#8217;ll do the will of God.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, we know the purpose of God&#8217;s existence. It&#8217;s found in Moses 1:39, &#8220;For behold, this is my work and my glory-to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.&#8221; The whole purpose of God, the basis of his glory, his power, his right to be a God, is based in others. His power comes because he is completely involved in helping his children. The key to becoming a God is to forget yourself and serve others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday in Priests Quorum, we were discussing some attributes found in the &#8220;For the Strength of Youth&#8221; pamphlet.
