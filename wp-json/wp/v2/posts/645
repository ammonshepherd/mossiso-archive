We must first remember that life is all about progression. Think, if you will, of an individual with a job. We see that they either do well and strive to improve their employment and skills, or they remain the same and stagnate. Now, just from what you have read about the individual, which do you feel is most important for that individual to do, progress or stagnate?\u00a0 I would be so bold as to wager that well nigh unto everybody will agree (while understanding the modern and Western concepts of jobs) that to progress is the good thing, and to stagnate is a bad thing. One can apply this to a role as spouse, parent, student, or what have you. In any role in life, we inherently seek to improve ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>We inherently (and I use inherently and not naturally to distinguish between the natural\/carnal desires and those inherited from our Heavenly parent) seek to improve our situations, our demeanors, our outlook, and well, everything. One problem arrises when we have a false notion of what improvement is and an appropriate way to achieve improvement.<\/p>\n<p>Anyhow, we must recognize that Jesus is the one who gave the Ten Commandments to Moses in the first place. It was Him, known at the time as Jehovah, who gave the Commandments to the people of Israel, that they might know how and for whom to look for for salvation.<\/p>\n<p>A BYU and a Ricks College professor discuss the doctrine of Jesus Christ of the New Testament being the God of the Old Testament, His role as a Father, and our relationship to Him.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"2\"><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Keith L. Sellers, visiting professor of ancient scripture, Brigham Young University, and Victor G. Forsnes, professor of engineering, Ricks College.<\/em> To better understand the Lord\u2019s words in Isaiah 44 and 45, we must first identify who is speaking. The passage indicates that it is \u201cthe king of Israel,\u201d the \u201cLord of Hosts\u201d (<a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/isa\/44\/\/6#6')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/isa\/44\/6#6\" target=\"contentWindow\">Isa. 44:6<\/a>)\u2014\u201ca just God and a Saviour\u201d (<a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/isa\/45\/\/21#21')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/isa\/45\/21#21\" target=\"contentWindow\">Isa. 45:21<\/a>). This is the God of the Old Testament, the Great I Am\u2014Jehovah.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"3\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Through Latter-day scripture, we know that <em>Jehovah<\/em> was the premortal name for Jesus Christ. \u201cBehold,\u201d Jesus told the Nephites, \u201cI am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted with my people Israel.\u201d (<a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/3_ne\/15\/\/5#5')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/3_ne\/15\/5#5\" target=\"contentWindow\">3 Ne. 15:5<\/a>; see also <a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/dc\/38\/\/1-4#1')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/dc\/38\/1-4#1\" target=\"contentWindow\">D&amp;C 38:1\u20134<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"4\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Jehovah, or Jesus Christ, is known by many other names. One of these is <em>the Son,<\/em> meaning the Son of God the Father. (See <a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/1_ne\/11\/\/18-21#18')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/1_ne\/11\/18-21#18\" target=\"contentWindow\">1 Ne. 11:18\u201321<\/a>.) In 1916, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve explained that \u201cJesus Christ is the Son of Elohim both as spiritual and bodily offspring; that is to say, Elohim is literally the Father of the spirit of Jesus Christ and also of the body in which Jesus Christ performed His mission in the flesh.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"5\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>They went on to declare that because of this unique relationship with God the Father, \u201cJesus the Son has represented and yet represents Elohim His Father in power and authority. This is true of Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied state, in the which He was known as Jehovah,\u201d as well as in mortality and today in his resurrected state. \u201cThe Father placed His name upon the Son,\u201d the First Presidency and Quorum of Twelve continued, \u201cand Jesus Christ spoke and ministered in and through the Father\u2019s name; and so far as power, authority and Godship are concerned His words and acts were and are those of the Father.\u201d (In James R. Clark, comp., <em>Messages of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,<\/em> 6 vols. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965\u201375), 5:27, 31\u201332.)<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"6\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Invested with this kind of authority, Jehovah can rightly speak to Israel as though he were the Father in matters involving their learning, understanding, and salvation. He was thus invested with the power of the Father in creating the earth and in his role as the Messiah\u2014the Christ, the Anointed One\u2014in performing the infinite and eternal atonement. He embodies the fulness of the Father\u2019s power, and in his role as the Mediator speaks and acts for the Father.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"7\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Jehovah also speaks properly and authoritatively as the Father in his role as (1) the Creator\u2014the Father of the heavens and the earth\u2014and (2) the Father of all who accept the gospel covenant and take upon themselves his name, whereby they are \u201cborn again\u201d as his sons and daughters and adopted into his family. (See <em>Messages of the First Presidency,<\/em> 5:26\u201334.)<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"8\"><\/a> Keeping in mind, then, that though the Father and the Son are separate beings, the Son, by divine investiture of authority, can speak as though he were God the Father\u2014and, in fact, in certain of his roles <em>is<\/em> a Father&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Jesus is Jehova\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lds.org\/ldsorg\/v\/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=205c2150a447b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1\" target=\"_blank\">Keith L.
