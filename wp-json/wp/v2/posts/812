The  prevailing thought by those who joined the military was that they would  be home by Christmas. Young men were bored with the good quality of life  so were eager to prove themselves and their new sense of national  identity. Because of advancements in technology (machine guns, tanks,  large guns, airplane) and changes in fighting (trench warfare, volunteer  army rather than conscripts) the war lasted much, much longer and was  much more devastating than planned. As secularism replaced religion, war  was the natural or scientific way to show nationalism and patriotism.<\/p>\n<p>There  is much contention, at least among German historians, about numerous  points leading up to the First World War. For German historians, the  issues stem around the internal or external focus of the Wilhelmine  government, the relative versus the actual influence and power of the  lower classes over the ruling elite, and when Germany first made a  decision to go to war, and the contentions surrounding German  preparations for war. Volker Berghahn provides an excellent discussion  on the historiography of Germany leading up to World War I. Refuting any  attempts at placing a Sonderweg to Nazi Germany, Berghahn argues that  Germany did not face different paths than other European countries, they  just made different choices. In other words, Germans faced the same  choices, they just reacted differently than other countries. Berghahn  shows how internal pressures from an &#8220;unstable&#8221; government (a rise in  the Social Democratic party demanding more power in the Reichstag for  the lower classes and an obdurate ruling elite unwilling to give up  power)\u00a0 and external pressures from countries who sought to keep Germany  restrained, eventually left German leaders feeling they had no other  alternative than to create what they hoped would be a small internal war  that would unify and subdue German speaking areas politically, and  provide breathing room for lack of ability to colonize off continent.  German leaders felt they were not able to decide if a war would happen,  so they chose to decide when it would happen.<\/p>\n<p>The war that  followed came as a shock to all participants. Everything came in greater  and staggering numbers. Loss of life in a single battle was immense  compared to previous wars. The war left a lasting and different  impression on each nation. War afflicted nearly half of all men in  France, and turned them into ultra pacifists. Their desire to refrain  from all future conflict led directly to complicit attitudes towards the  future Nazi party. Germans felt stabbed in the back and let resentment  and unfair reparations requirements foster in their culture. Forced to  employ a democratic government and divert a great percentage of their  economy to their enemies, Germany plunged much deeper into economic  depression and hyper inflation than other countries of the world that  experience the Great Depression. Germans became more politically  militant instead of democratic, and were left pining for the &#8220;Golden  Days&#8221; before the war.<\/p>\n<p>And the British&#8230; I haven&#8217;t read about them past 1914.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the picture below, drawn by Harris Morgan and submitted to wikimedia.org. I think it sums up nicely the different factors that led to the First World War. Perhaps one of the logs should be labeled &#8220;German political discord&#8221;. All of these external factors, plus the internal pressure of political change, fanned by the euphoric ideals of nationalism and trying to beat someone else (the arms race), led to a very uncivil expression of emotion.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_823\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-823\" style=\"width: 464px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/464px-WWI-Causes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-823  \" title=\"464px-WWI-Causes\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/464px-WWI-Causes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"464\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/464px-WWI-Causes.jpg 464w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/464px-WWI-Causes-232x300.jpg 232w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/464px-WWI-Causes-250x323.jpg 250w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/10\/464px-WWI-Causes-116x150.jpg 116w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-823\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Causes of World War I, Harris Morgan - http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:WWI-Causes.jpg<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4><strong>Work Cited:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Volker Rolf Berghahn, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Germany and the Approach of War in 1914<\/span>, 2nd ed.
