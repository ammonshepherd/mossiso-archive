Holland talks about the temptations of Christ, and how they are examples of how he was inconvenienced by choosing the better part. Being asked to turn stones into bread is a similar temptation we face when asked to participate in immoral practices.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;No one man, however brilliant or well-informed, can come in one lifetime to such fullness of understanding as to safely judge and dismiss the customs or institutions of his society, for these are the wisdom of generations after centuries of experiment in the laboratory of history. A youth boiling with hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires; and if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws, he may ruin his life before he matures sufficiently to understand that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group. [Will and Ariel Durant, The Lessons of History (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1968), pp. 35-36]<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And we have purposes the Durants never dreamed of, &#8220;promises to keep, and miles to go before we sleep&#8221; (Robert Frost, &#8220;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&#8221;). I plead with you not to yield to what one has called the &#8220;glandular stench&#8221; of our times. In your hours of temptation and vulnerability I ask you not, in your case, to turn bread into stone with that fire that has gone unbanked and uncooled. Those loaves will be millstones&#8211;bogus bread&#8211;weighted with heartache and despair and pain. Care more. It is too easy today with movies you can see and the magazines you can read. It is all tragically, painfully, cunningly convenient. In our time the only restraint left is self-restraint. I ask you to say of this highest, most intimate, most sacred physical expression, &#8220;Yes, but not this way.&#8221; I ask you to be inconvenienced until you&#8217;ve earned the right and paid the divine price to know the body and the soul of the one you love.&#8221; [<a title=\"Holland - Inconvenient Messiah\" href=\"http:\/\/speeches.byu.edu\/reader\/reader.php?id=6831&amp;x=57&amp;y=4\" target=\"_blank\">The Inconvenient Messiah<\/a>, Holland, Jeffrey R., BYU Devotional, February 15, 1982]<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\t&#8220;We have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families.&#8221; [Dallin H.
