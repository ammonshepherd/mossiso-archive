They really liked it, but as is always the case, there are some very good suggestions for improvement.  And since I have a vested interest in the project (my academic research interests are all about this topic), and since I&#8217;m pretty much the only one at work who can do this stuff, I will be continuing the project until it&#8217;s completion.<\/p>\n<p>Some suggestions and modifications are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move the text out of the Flash and into the html. This makes it available to search engines and styling.<\/li>\n<li>Have the timeline only be for 1989, and put tick marks, or some other designator for months on the bar.<\/li>\n<li>Change the fading of countries. Russia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, and Yugoslavia should not fade out.<\/li>\n<li>Change Soviet Union to Russia, and outline or shade the Yugoslavia and Soviet Union groups to show they are a group.<\/li>\n<li>Take out the events for China.<\/li>\n<li>For the yahoo Map: recenter the map on marker click, and take out the word wrapping.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So here&#8217;s the latest version of the Flash movie. <a href=\"http:\/\/historicalwebber.mossiso.com\/media\/1989events_05152007.html\">1989events<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I just turned in my last thing for the MA!
