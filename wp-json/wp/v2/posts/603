I finished Acts and have started Romans, and I&#8217;m astounded by the works of Paul. Despite constant tribulation he keeps the faith.<\/p>\n<p>In Romans chapter 3, he speaks to the believers and non believers in Rome. He testifies of Jesus Christ. He tells the people that it doesn&#8217;t matter if they are Jew or Gentile (non-Jew), because &#8220;is he not also [God] of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also&#8221; (<a title=\"Romans 3: 29\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/en\/rom\/3\/29\/#29\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 3: 29<\/a>). So God is the God of all people, not just the Jews. The acts and teachings of Jesus were for every human being, not just the Jews.<\/p>\n<p>Why then the special situation of the Jews? Paul explains that it had been the &#8220;advantage&#8221; for the Jewish population to have &#8220;committed&#8221; unto them the oracles of God. It was to this people that God gave the prophets, the seers, the revelators. To these people were given the &#8220;advantage&#8221; to be have the mouth piece of the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Does this mean salvation is only for the Jews. Of course not. Salvation is available for all human beings. How does it come? Through strict obedience to the Mosaic laws? No! But through faith on Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Romans 2: 27-28\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/rom\/2\/27-28\/#27\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 2: 27-28<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>27  Where <em>is<\/em> <sup>a<\/sup><a title=\"Alma 26: 36 (10-12, 36); D&amp;C 3: 4; D&amp;C 84: 73.\" type=\"A\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/en\/rom\/3\/27a\">boasting<\/a> then?

Yes, that&#8217;s what it means. Salvation does not depend on how well we follow the laws of Moses.

I&#8217;ll be looking at that through out this week.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Paul is a powerful preacher and prophet.
