Mills showed me some really great Flash maps for inspiration. They live at <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Maps of War\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mapsofwar.com\/maps.html\">MapsOfWar.com<\/a>.  I like the History of Religion map and the Imperial History map for their use of the timeline and map to convey the information. I want the 1989 map to be similar. The MapsOfWar maps are great reference points, and good examples from which to glean style ideas.<\/p>\n<p>I must say the hardest part of this project so far is the design. I&#8217;m no graphic artist, for sure.  My attempts at creating something that looks cool are quite pitiful. I can copy and mimic other people&#8217;s works, but trying to put my ideas into something concrete is difficult.  I should take some art classes.<\/p>\n<p>Anyhow. I worked on Scene 2 of the Flash intro. Getting a decent looking timeline took little effort. Creating the hammer and sickle (the hamsickle) that moves along the timeline was a bit time consuming. At first I used an image from Wikipedia (it was free). But scaling that in the timeline made it distorted and choppy. So I redrew the whole thing in Flash so that it is made from vectors, and scales nicely.<\/p>\n<p>Then I decided that using a single color map with the outline of the countries would work better than using the map I borrowed from the CIA (found it at the Library of Congress&#8217; online map collection). So I started tracing the country outlines. Soon I&#8217;ll have a decent looking map of East Europe that I can copy and manipulate in different ways.<\/p>\n<p>I also added some flash points to the timeline. They&#8217;re nothing fancy, and don&#8217;t correspond to any real data. I&#8217;ll get that stuff later.<\/p>\n<p>View the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Version 0.5\" href=\"http:\/\/historicalwebber.mossiso.com\/media\/1989events_32707.swf\">progress so far<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, I spent another 4 hours working on the Flash map.
