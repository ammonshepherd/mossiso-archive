Or at least your own from the past that works.<\/p>\n<p>I finally got the map to work for my Exhibit exhibit. <a href=\"http:\/\/chnm.gmu.edu\/staff\/ammon\/clio3\/tunnels.php\">See<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>First I copied the tutorial <a href=\"http:\/\/simile.mit.edu\/wiki\/Exhibit\/2.0\/Map_View_Tutorial\">here<\/a>. When that was working, I carefully copied it to the file I wanted it to be in and&#8230; nothing. Still broken.<\/p>\n<p>So next I commented out all extraneous stuff, and finally got it to work. Now came the fun part of tracking down what code was making my awesome map look like nothing. I narrowed it down to something within the &lt;header&gt; tag. So line by line I uncommented and tested until I tracked the issue down to the bootstrap.css file I was using.<\/p>\n<p>Then came the same process within the bootstrap.css file. It was easily 1000 lines long, so a line by line process wasn&#8217;t going to work. Instead I commented out the first have of the file. Bing, the map displayed, so it was somewhere within that first 500 lines. Then I commented out the first 250 lines. Bing again. I kept dividing the culprits in half until I narrowed it down to styles for the img tag. Commented those out and I was in business.<\/p>\n<p>Through that grueling process I lost the images of the documents on the first page. Now I have to figure out how to get those back, apply some styling and we&#8217;re all set.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t ever able to get it to pull in the data from a spreadsheet, so the JSON file will have to do. The process for making a JSON file from a spreadsheet is simple:<\/p>\n<p>1. Make the spreadsheet file so that the headers are encapsulated with curly braces &#8216;{ }&#8217;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1361\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-10-11 at 6.44.16 PM\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"76\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM.png 800w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM-300x28.png 300w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM-250x23.png 250w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM-150x14.png 150w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/Screen-Shot-2012-10-11-at-6.44.16-PM-624x59.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>2. If you&#8217;re using Google spreadsheets, export it as an Excel file. You&#8217;ll have to open it in Excel and save it as an older file format, because the next step doesn&#8217;t like .xlsx.<\/p>\n<p>3. Next, use <a href=\"http:\/\/service.simile-widgets.org\/babel\/\">Similie&#8217;s Babel tool<\/a> to convert the spreadsheet to JSON.<\/p>\n<p>4.
