E. Cavaignac: appointed provisional president of the French republic with the powers of a dictator, June 23, 1848<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>French history is replete with episodes of the populace coming to  terms  with their political ideas about republicanism and ideals about   nationalism. Throughout most of the 19th century, France waffled between   a republic and an aristocratic monarchy or empire.<\/p>\n<h4>Comparing Weber and Ford.<\/h4>\n<p>National vs local, nationalism vs individualism. Weber looks at the  peasants and periphery from the government&#8217;s perspective as they sought  to unify France with a national identity through language, education,  culture and politics. From the governments view point, the rural  population was a hindrance to modernization and improvement of France.  Those outside of Paris were backwards, coarse and ignorant. For Weber,  19th Century France is the struggle for national government to overcome  the periphery to create nationalism and a unified France.<\/p>\n<p>Ford sees things from the perspective of those in the periphery,  those outside of Paris. She argues that peasants and rural France were  intelligent, politically active, and interested in maintaining their  current culture and language. The Catholic democratic movement seen in  this century was an attempt of local areas to keep political autonomy by  using the Republican ideals to help create a new France, rather than  just be overpowered by the national, urban movement. Those in the  periphery were an active agent in creating France, rather than a passive  or resistant minority.<\/p>\n<p>Phillip Nord argues that France was finally able to create a stable  Republic in the last quarter of the 19th century as they built the  republic upon ideals of a civic-society and a civic-culture as the  government relinquished some national power in favor of local  authorities. In essence, the Third Republic allowed France to create  themselves instead of forming into the mold established by the  politicians.<\/p>\n<h2>Antisemitism<\/h2>\n<h4>Dreyfus Affair.<\/h4>\n<p>Hannah Arendt&#8217;s thoughts that Dreyfus Affair is important to study of  antisemitism, for it shows that such thoughts and feelings were  prevalent outside of Germany. Antisemitism was only one aspect of the  Dreyfus Affair, the perceived  decline of masculinity, anxiety about  modernity, the rise of feminism,  the rise in the bourgeois and the  intellectual, and the increase in  material wealth and leisure all  played a part in making much ado about  Dreyfus.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_749\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-749\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Dreyfus.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-749\" title=\"Dreyfus\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Dreyfus-300x269.jpg\" alt=\"Dreyfus\" width=\"300\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Dreyfus-300x269.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Dreyfus-250x224.jpg 250w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Dreyfus-150x134.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Dreyfus-624x559.jpg 624w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/Dreyfus.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-749\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Captain Alfred Dreyfus on the right.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jews were stereotyped as weak and effeminate, foreigners and   traitors. To combat this stereotype the Dreyfusards portrayed Dreyfus as   a Christ-like figure, being sacrificed before the populace. They   appealed to examples such as Emile Zola who changed from being obese to a   picture of health, as typical of Dreyfusard willpower and manliness.<\/p>\n<p>It was believed by both sides that the masculinity of French men was  in  decline, and that it was something men could choose. This was a   troubling recognition if true, for previous belief was that  masculinity  was a self-evident attribute of being born male, they had to  come to  grips with the thought that masculinity was a trait, that it  was  acquired by societal constraints. This could pull into question the   whole foundation of gender.<\/p>\n<h2>Colonialism.<\/h2>\n<p>Colonialism in 19th century France, as in all of Europe, was a sign  of power. A countries status and abilities rose with increased  territory, which came with resources. In the 20th Century the political  power achieved by controlling colonies was replaced by economic power  which was a result of a growing world market for resources and goods.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_748\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-748\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/AlgerianInfantry-e1287059623164.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-748\" title=\"Infantry, Algeria, 1853\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/AlgerianInfantry-e1287059672330-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Infantry, Algeria, 1853\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-748\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Infantry, Algeria, 1853<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>David Prochaska writes of France&#8217;s colonization of Algeria,  specifically settler colonization, in which France set out to make  Algeria a French state. Algeria was unique because more non-French  Europeans came to settle in Algeria, yet it retained its connection to  France. As such the status of France&#8217;s relationship with Algeria greatly  influenced the politics in France. When things were good in Algeria,  the people were content with the government, but as conflicts arose, so  did dissatisfaction with the Republic.<\/p>\n<p>Eric Jennings continues the history of French colonialism into World  War II by looking at three countries under Vichy control. Again, these  colonies were to show the French and their Nazi captors that they  retained political and world power, despite their loss and surrender to  Germany. As the Vichy instilled their own version of fascism built on  the cult of Petain. Not uniquely, as they foreign nation sought to build  up nationalism for France, the native populations developed their own  sense of nationalism until it became strong enough to overpower French  indoctrination.<\/p>\n<p>Such was the case as shown by Alistair Horne in Algeria after World  War II. Continuing tensions between native Algerians and the European  settlers lead to years of bloody conflicts resulting in the expulsion of  the French noir. Initially desiring to maintain control of Algeria to  further show military ability, de Gaulle eventually realized the need to  cut losses in Algeria and save France from civil unrest.<\/p>\n<h2>WWI and WWII.<\/h2>\n<p>The Great wars were devastating to France for two main reasons.  First, the number of men killed in each war left a devastating toll on  Frances population. Second, continual defeat at the hands of the Germans  crushed morale and confidence. As Eugen Weber argues, the French in  interwar Europe had become ultra pacifists, doing all they could to  avoid (which amounted to doing nothing to stop) another war.<\/p>\n<p>During World War II French politicians led France into another tangle  of actions that afflict French perceptions of themselves even to the  present day. One of the largest results of World War II is how they come  to terms with the Vichy involvement with the Nazis. During the reign of  Charles de Gualle, the national narrative was of the true French who  were the Resistance, and the anomaly of the Vichy government. Research  done in the 1960s and later has shown that the French were more complacent with the Vichy than the national narrative accounted for.  These new revelations have given the French a sort of mentality complex,  or as Henry Rousso terms it, a Vichy syndrome. Rousso states that the  French have a lasting issue with their memories of the Vichy government  because the ideological conflict that was WWII still exists, along with  the defeat in 1940 that left lasting scars, and the need to include the  Vichy government in any account of French history. The Vichy government  has become to French history as the Nazi past is to German. The atrocities of a decade seem to overpower the centuries of national  diversity.<\/p>\n<h2>Post-war National Identity<\/h2>\n<p>Since the mid 19th century, it seems the French have been continually dealing with a declining confidence in their national  virility and strength. One way France has found a way to regain national  identity is through technology. Gabrielle Hecht shows that France  sought to redeem their national identity through a competitive nuclear  power program. Their ability to innovate and achieve nuclear  sustainability became the new colonialism or victory in war. It showed  to themselves and the world that they were independent and still a world  power.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, what are the big issues in modern French History?
