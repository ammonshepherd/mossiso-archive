I refer, of course, to the history of man&#8217;s endeavors to explore space. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to step on a celestial body other than Earth. Michael Collins waited in the Command capsule as the two American astronauts made human history.<\/p>\n<p>So here are a number of resources and articles describing some cool things about space flight.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-21.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-281\" title=\"Apollo missions poster\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-21.png\" alt=\"Apollo missions poster\" width=\"150\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/historicspacecraft.com\/index.html\">Historic Spacecraft<\/a> is an archive of space vehicles and other things space related. They have a lot of photos of vehicles, suits, and such. They also have posters and such for sell, if you&#8217;re inclined to have something on your wall. They also have stats and dates for all of the rockets and vehicles listed. A great source for photos for all your space history needs. Also really cool is a list of all completed <a href=\"http:\/\/historicspacecraft.com\/Space_Shuttle.html#LIST\">Space Shuttle<\/a> missions. Space Shuttle Discovery has flown the most missions, 36, so far (June 2009) with a total of 126 missions. The Space Shuttle Enterprise never made it to space, but you can see it at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nasm.si.edu\/UdvarHazy\/\">Udvar-Hazy National Air and Space Museum<\/a> in Dulles, VA. I&#8217;ve been there a couple of times, and it is extremely awesome.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-6.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-285\" title=\"Apollo 11 interactive guide\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-6.png\" alt=\"Apollo 11 interactive guide\" width=\"150\" height=\"60\" \/><\/a>Next up from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flightglobal.com\/page\/Apollo-40th-Anniversary\/\">Flightglobal<\/a> is an interactive timeline of sorts, with lots of information about the missions, flights, computers, physics and people who made it possible to put man on the moon. Most amazing about the whole flight, is that everything was based on theory. There was no way to test the actual theoretical physics without flying to the moon and back. &#8220;Although the theoretical physics of travelling to the Moon had been laid down before the advent of the Apollo missions, this was the first time a series of manned missions had put the theory into practice.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-41.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-283\" title=\"apollo 11 software\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-41.png\" alt=\"apollo 11 software\" width=\"150\" height=\"61\" \/><\/a>Speaking of computers, <a href=\"http:\/\/linux.com\/news\/software\/developer\/29068-apollo-11-story\">Linux.com<\/a> has a neat write up about the software used to guide the Apollo 11 spacecraft to the moon and back. It&#8217;s incredible to think that they were able to do such an amazing thing with technology comparable to today&#8217;s calculators. All of the code used punch cards and took hours to see if it was written properly. Jerry Bostick described the process in the Linux.com article:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We would give instructions to the programs by punching cards,&#8221; Bostick said. &#8220;You had to wait at least 12 hours to see if it would work right.&#8221; The early programming was done in the real-time computing complex in Houston using IBM 7094 computers with 64K of memory. There were no hard disks. All the data was stored on magnetic tape, with each computer having about eight tape drives. Most programs used for the mission were written in Fortran, Bostick said. &#8220;After Apollo 1, we upgraded to the biggest and the best equipment that government money could buy, the IBM 360 with an unheard of 1MB of memory. We went all the way from 64K to 1MB.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-5.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-284\" title=\"lunar lander games\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/Picture-5.png\" alt=\"lunar lander games\" width=\"150\" height=\"63\" \/><\/a>Moving from space computers to space computer games, the <a href=\"http:\/\/technologizer.com\/2009\/07\/19\/lunar-lander\/\">Technologizer<\/a> has a great piece about a well loved space game, Lunar Lander.
