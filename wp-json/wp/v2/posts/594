This is the story of Jesus healing the blind man on the Sabbath day. I think there are two important lessons to learn here. One about faith, and the other about the Sabbath day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Faith<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jesus heals a man that has been blind from birth. All of the Jews know him (the Pharisees at least), so they know that he is truly blind. But in their hard hearts and spiteful minds, they can not see the great miracle that happened, and only see the supposed violation of the <a title=\"Activities prohibited on Shabbat\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Activities_prohibited_on_Shabbat\" target=\"_blank\">law<\/a> of the <a title=\"Shabbat\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shabbat\" target=\"_blank\">Sabbath<\/a>. The Pharisees had always wanted a miracle to happen for them to believe Jesus, yet here is one they can not deny, but won&#8217;t believe because they interpret the act as a violation of a law. The Pharisees question the man, trying to understand, and trying to find some proof that Jesus is of the devil. I love the reply of the man who was healed.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>30  The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <em>yet<\/em> he hath opened mine eyes.<br \/>\n31  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.<br \/>\n32  Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born <sup>a<\/sup><a title=\"JST John 9: 32  . . .  except he be of God.\" type=\"H\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/en\/john\/9\/32a\">blind<\/a>.<br \/>\n33  If this man were not of <sup>a<\/sup><a title=\"Acts 2: 22.\" type=\"A\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/en\/john\/9\/33a\">God<\/a>, he could do nothing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The man, through logic and faith, testifies that any man who can heal a blind man must be of God. The Pharisees, with pride and unbelief, cast him out. Jesus seeks out the man and asks him if he believes on the Son of God. The man wants to know who he is, and upon learning it is Jesus, immediately believes and worships him.<\/p>\n<p>Such great faith. We must also have such great faith. It comes only when your heart and mind are open to receive it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sabbath<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The other lesson to learn is about the Sabbath day. Division arose among the Pharisees because some believed the breaking of the Sabbath law greater than the miracle done. Others questioned, can a sinner do such a great miracle? This brings out the great debate between the letter and the spirit of the law. In this case Jesus broke neither, but it is a question and debate we should all have with our Sabbath observance. Jesus did not break the letter of the law. As he explained at a different occurance, even the Pharisees will feed and <a title=\"water the ox and ass on a Sabbath\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/en\/luke\/13\/15#15\" target=\"_blank\">water their animals<\/a>, should not a human being be blessed with site?<\/p>\n<p>I have read often how the current prophets and apostles have declared that the Sabbath day should be kept holy. That great blessings come from this observance, and great calamities come with breaking it. I&#8217;m always amazed at people who claim to have a strong belief in Jesus Christ a testimony and desire to follow his commandments, yet can not follow one of the simple <a title=\"the Ten Commandments\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/en\/ex\/20\/3-17#3\" target=\"_blank\">Ten Commandments<\/a>. They shop, work, and play on the Sabbath day, and it&#8217;s just not right. They break the law and the spirit when they do not have their hearts set on serving other people and worshiping God.<\/p>\n<p>Anyhow, those were a couple of thoughts I had today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I read John chapter 8 today.
