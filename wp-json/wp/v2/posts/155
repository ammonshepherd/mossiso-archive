This commandment is for everybody, whether Jew, Gentile, Muslim, Christian, atheist, Buddhist, or what have you. One of the fundamental principles of this commandment is the need to focus on one great goal, and if everybody is working towards that same goal, there is a greater chance for harmony and peace. I might even suggest that we take the world as it is now. There are many different religions, we each believe in a God, yet in perhaps different terms. Following this commandment, as it applies to each individuals religion (as set forth by that individuals standard and set forth religious beliefs), will help those individuals focus on that which is most important. I&#8217;m no scholar on any religion but my own, but I think it&#8217;s safe to say, if everybody put their God first, as He and their religions truly suggest, then there would be less bickering, less immorality, less deceit, less selfishness.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_157\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-157\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/goldcalf.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-157\" title=\"goldcalf\" src=\"http:\/\/ammica.us\/ammon\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/goldcalf-300x208.jpg\" alt=\"The Golden Calf\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/goldcalf-300x208.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/goldcalf-250x173.jpg 250w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/goldcalf-150x104.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/goldcalf-624x432.jpg 624w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/goldcalf.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-157\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Golden Calf<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Now if we apply the fourth requirement, we would ideally all recognize that Jesus is the God of the Old Testament. He it was that said there shall be no other gods before me. That means we should all accept Jesus Christ as our God, and along with that our Savior. It was Jesus who created all things as directed by our Father in Heaven. It is Jesus who is the author of our salvation, through the Atonement. He, in a very real sense, is the father and God of the &#8220;born again&#8221; or &#8220;new&#8221; person that we are to become when we go through the continual process of accepting, applying, and renewing the Atonement in our lives. As we put God and Jesus first in our lives, we focus on the things they want us to do, and ultimately become like them (see <a title=\"Matthew 5: 48\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/en\/matt\/5\/48#48\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew 5: 48<\/a> and <a title=\"3 Nephi 12: 48\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/en\/3_ne\/12\/48#48\" target=\"_blank\">3 Nephi 12: 48<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>So, in summary, when we have no other gods before God, we are able to all have the same focus and intent, which helps us work together, which cuts back on the conflicts. There are many other facets to this commandment, and probably all more important than I just summarized. Below are a few quotes from modern Apostles about following the first of the ten commandments.<\/p>\n<p class=\"citation\"><strong>In order to have no other gods before God the Father, we must love Him.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"citation\">James E.

Without this faith, the prophet Mormon said, we are not fit to be numbered among the people of the Lord\u2019s Church (see <a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/moro\/7\/\/39#39')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/moro\/7\/39#39\" target=\"contentWindow\">Moroni 7:39<\/a>). The first commandment Jehovah gave to the children of Israel was \u201cThou shalt have no other gods before me\u201d (<a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/ex\/20\/\/3#3')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/ex\/20\/3#3\" target=\"contentWindow\">Exodus 20:3<\/a>). We should always put the Savior first. This powerful idea\u2014that we must have faith and put the Lord first in our lives\u2014seems simple, but in practice many find it difficult.<\/p>\n<p>The scriptures teach us that faith comes by hearing the word of God (see <a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/rom\/10\/\/17#17')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/rom\/10\/17#17\" target=\"contentWindow\">Romans 10:17<\/a>). The word of God, which comes to us by scripture, by prophetic teaching, and by personal revelation, teaches us that we are children of God the Eternal Father. It teaches us about the identity and mission of His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. Founded on our knowledge of those truths, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is a conviction and trust that God knows us and loves us and will hear our prayers and answer them with what is best for us.<\/p>\n<p>Faith in the Lord is trust in the Lord. We cannot have true faith in the Lord without also having complete trust in the Lord\u2019s will and in the Lord\u2019s timing. As a result, no matter how strong our faith is, it cannot produce a result contrary to the will of Him in whom we have faith. Remember this when your prayers do not seem to be answered in the way or at the time you desire. The exercise of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is always subject to the order of heaven, to the goodness and will and wisdom and timing of the Lord. When we have that kind of faith and trust in the Lord, we have true security and serenity in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>We look first to our Savior, Jesus Christ. He is our model. Our model is not the latest popular hero of sports or entertainment. Similarly, our most precious possessions are not the expensive toys and diversions that encourage us to concentrate on what is temporary and to forget what is eternal. Our model\u2014our first priority\u2014is Jesus Christ. We must testify of Him and teach one another how we can apply His teachings and His example in our lives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When servants become masters, we have other gods before us.

And that such things should be found even among the Saints to some degree is scarcely believable, for these are a people who are in possession of many gifts of the Spirit, who have knowledge that lets them put the eternities into perspective, who have been shown the way to eternal life.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, however, we find that to be shown the way is not necessarily to walk in it, and many have not been able to continue in faith. These have submitted themselves in one degree or another, to the enticings of Satan and his servants, and joined with those of \u201cthe world\u201d in lives of ever-deepening idolatry.<\/p>\n<p>I use the word <em>idolatry <\/em>intentionally. As I study ancient scripture, I am more and more convinced that there is significance in the fact that the commandment \u201cThou shalt have no other gods before me\u201d is the first of the Ten Commandments.<\/p>\n<p>Few men have ever knowingly and deliberately chosen to reject God and his blessings. Rather, we learn from the scriptures that because the exercise of faith has always appeared to be more difficult than relying on things more immediately at hand, carnal man has tended to transfer his trust in God to material things. Therefore, in all ages when men have fallen under the power of Satan and lost the faith, they have put in its place a hope in the \u201carm of flesh\u201d (<a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/dc\/1\/\/19#19')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/dc\/1\/19#19\" target=\"contentWindow\">D&amp;C 1:19<\/a>) and in \u201cgods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know\u201d (<a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/dan\/5\/\/23#23')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/dan\/5\/23#23\" target=\"contentWindow\">Dan. 5:23<\/a>)\u2014that is, in idols. This I find to be a dominant theme in the Old Testament.

But I am afraid that many of us have been surfeited with flocks and herds and acres and barns and wealth and have begun to worship them as false gods, and they have power over us. Do we have more of these good things than our faith can stand? Many people spend most of their time working in the service of a self-image that includes sufficient money, stocks, bonds, investment portfolios, property, credit cards, furnishings, automobiles, and the like to <em>guarantee <\/em>carnal security throughout, they hope a long and happy life. Forgotten is the fact that our assignment is to use these many resources in our families and quorums to build up the kingdom of God\u2014to further the missionary effort and the genealogical and temple work; to raise our children up as fruitful servants unto the Lord; to bless others in every way, that they may also be fruitful. Instead, we expend these blessings on our own desires, and as Moroni said, \u201cYe adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not.\u201d (<a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/morm\/8\/\/39#39')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/morm\/8\/39#39\" target=\"contentWindow\">Morm. 8:39<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>As the Lord himself said in our day, \u201cThey seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and <em>whose substance is that of an idol, <\/em>which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon, the great, which shall fall.\u201d (<a class=\"scriptureRef\" onclick=\"newWindow('http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/dc\/1\/\/16#16')\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/dc\/1\/16#16\" target=\"contentWindow\">D&amp;C 1:16<\/a>; italics added.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>And so it often seems to be with people, having such a firm grasp on things of the world\u2014that which is telestial\u2014that no amount of urging and no degree of emergency can persuade them to let go in favor of that which is celestial.
