Here is <a title=\"Horton 2-29\" href=\"http:\/\/resound1.com\/nazi-stealth-jet-could-have-won-war-for-hitler\/\" target=\"_blank\">a site<\/a> with a number of cool pictures. National Geographic has a cool documentary about a team of engineers at Northrop Grumman who reconstructed the airplane to test it&#8217;s stealth abilities. Most amazing of all, I think, is that the plane was made from wood! That and several layers of paint, aparently, are what make it nearly invisible to radar. I&#8217;ll have to do some research into this machine and write up a history of it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nazi history is always a good way to sell news, and get people to read.
