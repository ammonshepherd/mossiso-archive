So, to get rid of bad thoughts, they must be replaced with good. To get rid of evil actions and intents, they must be replaced with righteous ones. Bad habits can not just be stopped, but must be replaced with good habits. The people that King Benjamin spoke to first heard the Gospel, then they believed it. The Spirit bore testimony and changed them, or the Spirit was a catalyst in their changing.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Alma 19: 33\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/alma\/19\/33\/#33\" target=\"_blank\">Alma 19: 33<\/a> &#8211; Ammon teaches Lamoni and his people. They experience an overpowering of the Spirit, through which their hearts are changed and they desire evil no more. So studying the Gospel, listening to the prophets, and letting the Spirit work in us helps us to have a change of heart.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Alma 13: 12\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/alma\/13\/12\/#12\" target=\"_blank\">Alma 13:12<\/a> &#8211; Alma speaks to the people in Ammoniahah after the <a title=\"Alma contends with Zeezrom\" href=\"http:\/\/scriptures.lds.org\/alma\/12\" target=\"_blank\">episode with Zeezrom<\/a>.
