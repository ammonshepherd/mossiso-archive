Beginning this new year, I will be the full-time Manager\nof the Scholars\u2019 Lab Makerspace and the Lead Research Technologist. I started\nin the Scholars\u2019 Lab 5 years ago as a Digital Humanities Developer, building\nwebsites, working on various projects, and helping to maintain our technical\ninfrastructure.  Since then I have enjoyed learning the technology and skills\navailable in the Makerspace, and, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Camel%27s_nose\">like the metaphorical\ncamel<\/a>, I found a way to get\nmyself all in. \ud83d\ude0a<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the beginning (Summer 2014), the Makerspace had a great vision\nunder the outstanding leadership of Laura Miller and Jeremy Boggs. As their\nroles have changed over the years, this left an opportunity for me to join the\nMakerspace team full-time. As Manager, I will oversee the administration and\nday-to-day running of the Makerspace and supervise our wonderful team of\nstudent employees who we affectionately call Makerspace Technologists. As the\nLead Research Technologist, I will conduct research about Makerspace\ntechnology, methodology and pedagogy, and collaborate with scholars throughout\nthe UVA community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new year and the new decade, we\u2019ve enhanced our vision of the Makerspace, and put in place a mission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"scholars-lab-makerspace-vision\">Scholars\u2019 Lab Makerspace Vision<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>The Scholars\u2019 Lab Makerspace is strategically situated within the UVA Library to be open, provide a low barrier to entry, and be a helpful resource of information, technology and support. The space invites all people, and proactively encourages those in underrepresented academic studies, ethnicities, genders, economic classes and skill levels to come, learn, make, and be empowered to improve their education, research, and community. The Makerspace is an active participant in academic research through independent and collaborative work with scholars to explore, understand, and report on emerging technologies, methodologies and pedagogies in a variety of disciplines.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mission\">Mission<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>All humans are dreamers, creators, and achievers.
