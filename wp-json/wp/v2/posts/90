We&#8217;d throw the board into the middle of the river (this used in the broadest sense of the term, since Arizona isn&#8217;t too well known for flowing bodies of water), jump on and ride the current.  We&#8217;d jump the board and do tricks like head stands, hand stands, back flips, etc. It was the source of very fond memories.<\/p>\n<p>Well, imagine my surprise, when looking up some information about Wernher von Braun for a school paper today, and here he is, &#8220;water-boarding&#8221; in the middle of the Tennessee River!
