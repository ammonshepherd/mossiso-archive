More specifically, I&#8217;ll look at how popular, political and scientific attitudes about science and technology influenced German leaders going into World War II. Germany had some pretty incredible technology in World War II. They had the first jet aircraft, the first ballistic missile, and this awesome airplane (<a href=\"http:\/\/historicalwebber.mossiso.com\/nazis-in-the-news-211.html\">I have posted about before<\/a>)!<\/p>\n<p>I also found an <a href=\"http:\/\/web.ebscohost.com.mutex.gmu.edu\/ehost\/detail?vid=1&amp;hid=107&amp;sid=3817a2be-ffde-4700-9c0b-c6517e73cc8a%40sessionmgr110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&amp;AN=H001298113.01\">interesting quote<\/a> from Hitler, where he supposedly said &#8220;Germany&#8217;s technology, industry, and morale were sufficient to fight an indefinite war.&#8221; So was there something in the Weimar period that lead Hitler to believe this. Certainly he did, as did the scientists and researchers who were so innovative.<\/p>\n<p>So now I&#8217;ll come up with a better one paragraph proposal, and I might feel comfortable enough about it to post it. And now it&#8217;s on to find sources (primary and secondary) about popular, political, and from the field itself, attitudes about science and technology in Weimar Germany! I&#8217;ll start by looking in the field of aviation, since that is my passion, if I have such a thing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I needed to rethink my proposal for my paper.
