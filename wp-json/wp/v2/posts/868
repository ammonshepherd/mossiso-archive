in English.\u00a0 <em>Sonderweg<\/em> was mainly a derogatory term used by its critics.<\/p>\n<p>After 1940, the positive <em>Sonderweg<\/em> was no longer developed or used.\u00a0 A critical <em>Sonderweg<\/em> took the place of the positive reflection of German history, with the new one attempting to answer one prominent question; How did Germany produce a society and political atmosphere where National Socialism could come to power? \u00a0Proponents of this <em>Sonderweg<\/em> thesis have been Ernst Fraenkel, Hans Rosenberg, George Mosse, Fritz Stern, Karl-Dietrich Bracher, Gerhard A.\u00a0 Ritter, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Heinrich August Winkler, Helmut Plessner, Leonard Krieger, Kurt Sontheimer, John Maynard Keynes, Fritz Fischer, Wolfgang Mommsen.<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Those who argued for a critical <em>Sonderweg<\/em> put forth the following points for seeing Germany\u2019s special path to National Socialism.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sonderweg<\/em> proponents were cautious about asserting a &#8220;necessary relationship between long-term developments in German History and the triumph of National Socialism,\u201d but in the end were specifically looking for peculiarities in German politics that hindered a liberal democracy from developing.<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Germany had a relatively late attempt at creating a nation state.\u00a0 France and the United States of America formed, or attempted to form, a nation in the late eighteenth century.\u00a0 It was nearly one hundred years, finally in 1871, that Germany was able to form a federal government.<\/li>\n<li><em>Sonderweg<\/em> proponents hearken back to the <em>Kaiserreich<\/em> government\u2019s oppressive practices that limited parliament and caused what parties that did form to be rigid and fragmented.<\/li>\n<li>German defeat in World War I is seen as an important part of the German <em>Sonderweg<\/em>.\u00a0 The devastating defeat in the First World War left German confidence in tatters.\u00a0 Coupled with the limiting and demeaning restrictions of the Versailles Treaty, Germany seemed anxious to prove to themselves and Europeans that they were a nation of worth.\u00a0 The defeat also led Germany into a new phase of government different, full parliamentary constitution with no monarchy or empire.<\/li>\n<li>Germany&#8217;s political culture tended to be conservative.\u00a0 This made it difficult for liberal parties to be effective.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;Junkers-the large agrarian landowners east of the Elbe River&#8221; (similar to the English gentry) retained much of their power.\u00a0 Whereas other nations had developed a parliament with representative leaders, much of Germany\u2019s power still lay with landed aristocrats.<\/li>\n<li>Bismarck&#8217;s forming the nation-state with &#8220;Blut und Eisen&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;blood and iron&#8221; which put emphasis on the military, and left them unchecked by parliament.\u00a0 This gave a militaristic approach to German government that lasted through the Weimar Republic and into National Socialism.<\/li>\n<li>The unbourgeois-ness of the bourgeoisie.\u00a0 They never really revolted against the aristocratic society and political culture.\u00a0 There was no middle class of people to rise up in rebellion as there were in other Western states.\u00a0 As a result Germany was left without a tradition of successful revolutions and a history of top-down reforms.\u00a0 Combined with pressure from the peasants, the middle classes were politically weak.<\/li>\n<li>Germany experienced a strange mixture of social and economic modernization and industrialization and capitalism on one hand, but maintained the old power relations, pre-industrial institutions, and cultures.\u00a0 It was an odd combination of old powers, cultures and organizations in charge of new social and economic conditions and ways of production.<\/li>\n<li>All of these &#8220;long-term patterns&#8221; came to a head with the &#8220;short-term factors&#8221; of 1920s and 1930s, and help to explain the collapse of the Weimar Republic and rise of National Socialism.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8220;In a nutshell, the critical <em>Sonderweg<\/em> thesis claimed to indentify long-term structures and processes that, under the influence of numerous other factors (from the consequences of defeat in World War I through the class conflicts of the 1920s to the peculiarities of Adolf Hitler&#8217;s personality), contributed to the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the triumph of National Socialism&#8221;.<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Historians opposed or critical of the <em>Sonderweg<\/em> have based their critiques partly on methodology.\u00a0 Opponents to the <em>Sonderweg<\/em> thesis have been Thomas Nipperdey, David Blackbourn, Geoff Eley, Ernst Nolte, J\u00fcrgen Kocka, Fran\u00e7ois Furet,Friedrich Meinecke.<\/p>\n<p>Their opposition consists of the following points:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several historical continuities to be seen in German history.\u00a0 For example the <em>Kaiserreich<\/em> is also a prehistory of the Federal Republic of Germany.\u00a0 This line of reasoning suggests that as National Socialism fades farther into the past, it becomes less of a clear case that the collapse of the Weimar Republic led to National Socialism.\u00a0 Supporting a <em>Sonderweg<\/em> assumes there is a &#8220;normal path&#8221; that Germany could have taken.\u00a0 To define what a &#8220;normal&#8221; path is, is much to subjective a &#8220;value judgment,&#8221; and the belief in the superiority of &#8220;the West&#8221;.<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>A research in Bielefeld has shown that the aristocratic influence (or dominance) over the middle class was no greater in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Germany than in other western European nations.\u00a0 International comparisons have shown, contrary to <em>Sonderweg<\/em> hypothesis, that the educated German middle class was &#8220;strong and clearly contoured&#8221;.<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]<\/a> It was a widespread European trait for the bourgeois to turn from liberalism in nineteenth century.<\/li>\n<li>The <em>Kaiserreich<\/em> did show signs of modernism.\u00a0 It was &#8220;full of modern dynamism, for example in the areas of science and scholarship, art and culture&#8221;.<a href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Intensive recent research seems to point to National Socialism as a modern phenomenon, rather than the results of past traditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some core aspects of the <em>Sonderweg<\/em> have been supported, though, through recent research in three ways:<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three of the basic developmental problems of modern societies showed themselves at the same time only in Germany.\u00a0 1) Formation of the nation-state, 2) decision to have a constitution (parliament) or no, 3) issues with society brought by industrialization.\u00a0 Other countries dealt with these individually, that is, with generations, or at least decades, of time in between to iron out difficulties.<a href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While issues with the middle class, the bourgeoisie, cannot be discounted, they did have less of an effect on Germany society than in other European countries.<a href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Germany had a &#8220;bureaucratic tradition&#8221; of a strong authoritarian state.\u00a0 Such power in the hands of the state blocked parliament from functioning, provided effective services to the people, and weakened middle class liberalism.\u00a0 When a democratic government finally did have power, after World War I in the form of the Weimar Republic, the inability of the leaders to provide a stable economy and society meant Germans were eager, or at least willing, to go back to a strong authoritarian state.\u00a0 Important to realize, though, is that the rise of National Socialism should be seen separate from the fall of the Weimar Republic.\u00a0 National Socialism was too new to have broken apart the Weimar Republic; it merely picked up the pieces.<\/p>\n<p>With the Federal Republic the <em>Sonderweg<\/em> ended for West Germany.\u00a0 It became a &#8220;normal&#8221; western nation.\u00a0 East Germany, continued the <em>Sonderweg<\/em>, much altered of course, until its collapse in 1989-90.<a href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Sonderweg<\/em><\/strong><strong> Bibliography<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Proponents<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bracher, Karl Dietrich, ed. <em>Deutscher Sonderweg, Mythos Oder Realita\u0308t?<\/em> Mu\u0308nchen: R.
