I wondered if they will become more active as they get older, have kids, and realize the great things they missed out on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Toothbrush Analogy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a kid, you might not like brushing your teeth. For whatever reason, you&#8217;ve decided that it&#8217;s not for you. Your parents might have made you do it. You might not like the dentist visits: they make you feel uncomfortable, you might not believe the things they say, etc. Perhaps the thought of having to brush morning and night, day in and day out, no breaks, no holidays, just makes you upset. For whatever reason, you just don&#8217;t like to brush.<\/p>\n<p>Well, one day you are going to realize the importance of teeth brushing. It might be as a kid, still, when you get 5 cavities that hurt like the dickens. You might realize that if you take care of your teeth you won&#8217;t get cavities and they won&#8217;t hurt. It might be as an adult when you have to pay for your own cavities, or when you have your own kids and have to pay for theirs. It might even be when you&#8217;re putting in your brand new set of dentures, that you finally realize that if you had taken care of your teeth, that you would still have some.<\/p>\n<p>The Gospel is the same way. Whether you don&#8217;t believe, or don&#8217;t want to. Whether your parent&#8217;s made you go to Church and Seminary, or because you don&#8217;t like the bishop office visits, or because you have to live the commandments morning and night, day in and day out, no breaks, no holidays&#8230; Or for whatever reason you don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>There will come a day when you will <strong>have<\/strong> to acknowledge and finally realize that the Gospel is true. You will <strong>have<\/strong> to acknowledge that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true Church of God in these times. You will bow to your knees and acknowledge that Jesus Christ is your Savior, Creator, and Redeemer. The day may come when you feel the Spirit at a meeting you were forced to attend, or when you see a small miracle happen in your life. It may come when you are having hard times as an adult and finally humble yourself to God. It might come when you have kids of your own and you realize how much the Church and the Gospel and Christ can really do for you. It might even come after you die and are forced to acknoweldge the further existence of your spirit. It might be when you stand before Jesus Christ and take an account of all your thoughts, words, and deeds-good and bad-and are judged accordingly. Whatever the reason, one day you WILL realize the TRUTH.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t wait for your teeth to fall out before you realize that brushing your teeth is a good thing. And don&#8217;t wait until you are standing before our Savior Jesus Christ to finally acknowledge that what you have been and are being taught is the truth. Gain a testimony now! Do the simple things to gain the greatest. Say your prayers, read the scriptures, live the commandments. Prepare yourself so that day may be a Great one and not a Terrible one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This was one of the previous posts&#8230; These are thoughts I had once while thinking about members of my family who are inactive, and while brushing my teeth.
