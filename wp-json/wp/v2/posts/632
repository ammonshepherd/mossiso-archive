Jesus is resurrected and we will be too.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This lesson focused on Jesus raising Lazarus from death. The following two quotes show the importance of the miracle:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why this studied buildup, this centering of attention upon one of the mightiest miracles of his ministry? Two reasons in particular stand out. (1) As our Lord neared the climax of his mortal ministry, he was again bearing testimony, in a way that could not be refuted, of his Messiahship, of his divine Sonship, of the fact that he was in very deed the literal Son of God; and (2) He was setting the stage, so as to dramatize for all time, one of his greatest teachings: That he was the resurrection and the life, that immortality and eternal life came by him, and that those who believed and obeyed his words should never die spiritually&#8221; (Elder Bruce R. McConkie, <em>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary<\/em>, 1:530-31)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;No question as to the actual death of Lazarus could be raised, for his demise had been witnessed, his body had been prepared and buried in the usual way, and he had lain in the grave four days. At the tomb, when he was called forth, there were many witnesses, some of them prominent Jews, many of whom were unfriendly to Jesus and who would have readily denied the miracle had they been able. God was glorified and the divinity of the Son of Man was vindicated in the result&#8221; (Elder James E. Talmage, <em>Jesus the Christ<\/em>, 496)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What came first, the chicken or the egg?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-115\" title=\"egg\" src=\"http:\/\/ammica.us\/ammon\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/egg-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"egg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-114\" title=\"chicken\" src=\"http:\/\/ammica.us\/ammon\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/chicken-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"chicken\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What comes first, signs or faith?
