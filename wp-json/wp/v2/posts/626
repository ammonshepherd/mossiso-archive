We hope for an outcome we do not know for sure will happen.\u00a0 We pay 10% of our income to the Church as tithing because of faith.\u00a0 \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d is what we ask.<\/li>\n<li> Charity:\u00a0 Galatians 4:14 \u201cFor all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d\u00a0 Charity is the greatest commandment, the ultimate motivator, the eternal force.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In trying circumstances, charity helps us suspect the best in others.\u00a0 For example, when work is stressful and sleep is extra-needful, a crying baby throughout the night can make a parent want to pull out hair and scream with frustration and weariness.\u00a0 But by applying the lens of charity to our view of he situation, we can filter our perspective, gain control of out thoughts and emotions, and act with love &#8211; even act as Christ would act.\u00a0 We realize that a baby is continually learning.\u00a0 He must learn to put himself back to sleep at night, must learn to be calm.\u00a0 As a\u00a0 parent, I am to teach that child.\u00a0 There is no ill or malicious intent in a baby, and believe it or not, neither is there in small children.\u00a0 Moroni teaches us in Moroni 8:8, little children are not capable of committing sin.\u00a0 They are all in a learning process.\u00a0 Our love for them and our level of charity will allow us to see their intentions as positive, and allow us to teach in a loving manner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Repentance is a gift of charity<\/strong><br \/>\nWe should not be discouraged when we find ourselves falling short and using the lesser motivators.\u00a0 One of the greatest acts of charity that Christ gives us constantly is that of repentance.\u00a0 Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said: \u201cYou can change anything you want to change and you can do it very fast. That\u2019s another Satanic sucker-punch\u2014that it takes years and years and eons of eternity to repent. It takes exactly as long to repent as it takes you to say \u2018I\u2019ll change\u2019\u2014and mean it. Of course there will be problems to work out and restitutions to make. You may well spend\u2014indeed you had better spend\u2014the rest of your life proving your repentance by its permanence. But change, growth, renewal, repentance can come for you as instantaneously as it did for Alma and the Sons of Mosiah\u201d (\u201cTempering Our Tempers,\u201d Ensign, Feb 2008, 54\u201357).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Christ is the perfect example<\/strong><br \/>\nChrist is the perfect example of every good thing.\u00a0 As we look to Christ for examples of how to live our lives, we see that humility and charity will play a central role.\u00a0 We truly \u201cfind our lives\u201d by losing it for His sake.\u00a0 Through charity we learn how to view or situations as God does.\u00a0 There is always a choice in how we feel.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>February 10, 2008\u00a0 Sacrament meeting talk.\u00a0 by Ammon Shepherd Charity = the highest, noblest, strongest kind of love; a prompting motive of actions.
