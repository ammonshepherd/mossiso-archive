They have about ten years worth of the &#8216;Kosmos&#8217; magazine from 1919-1927 that I will look at for my paper. It was really fun. The whole family went down. Jess and I both got new LoC cards, then they went to a museum and I went to read old books.<\/p>\n<p>Up until this point my big worry had been in finding some primary documents. Now that I have them, I don&#8217;t know what to do with them. I proposed this dilemma to the class last night and they had some great ideas on how to use the source. I also have a great article to use as a template, in that the historian, Nick Hopwood, looks at the &#8216;Urania&#8217; magazine used by the socialists in Weimar Germany. (Nick Hopwood, \u201cProducing a Socialist Popular Science in the Weimar Republic,\u201d <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">History Workshop Journal<\/span>, no. 41 (Spring 1996): 117-153.)<\/p>\n<p>Reading this article is my goal for tonight&#8217;s short two hour study session. I&#8217;m planning on going back to the LoC on Thursday to get some more data. But here are the ideas my classmates had:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>look at a particular author that continually prints<\/li>\n<li>look at one science\/tech, follow how Nazi magazines and others treat  the topic<\/li>\n<li>look at old and new to see if they deal with a subject<\/li>\n<li>what happened to the authors of the socialist papers<\/li>\n<li>study what kind of articles are being printed, what topics come up  continually<\/li>\n<li>what happened to the authors\/editors of the socialist papers, did  they go to Dachau, were the scientists who published put to work in  their fields?<\/li>\n<li>narrow down the so what question. What question are you trying to  answer, that will help you know what to look for in the sources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_383\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-383\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/5-adams.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-383\" title=\"Library of Congress - John Adams Building - 5th floor\" src=\"http:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/5-adams-300x249.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"249\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/5-adams-300x249.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/5-adams-250x208.jpg 250w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/5-adams-150x124.jpg 150w, https:\/\/mossiso.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/02\/5-adams.jpg 485w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Library of Congress - John Adams Building - 5th floor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>What the issue really boils down to is that I need to narrow my topic. I can&#8217;t have my topic be &#8216;science and technology in Weimar Germany&#8217;. That&#8217;s way too broad. Too broad for a dissertation, even. I like the idea of focusing on one particular science or technology, and see how it is portrayed throughout the Weimar Republic, and even into post-Weimar Germany. Ideally, it aligns with my dissertation topic of Nazi tunnels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So I finally went to the Library of Congress for actual archival research.
