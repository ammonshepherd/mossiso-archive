					<description><![CDATA[So glad you had this posted!  It was mentioned in stake conference today, reviewing what was told a few years ago.  I also was unable to write it down due to our young children, but have been looking on the internet for the eight &quot;ates&quot; and finally found them here.  Thank you!]]></description>
