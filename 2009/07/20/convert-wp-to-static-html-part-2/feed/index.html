					<description><![CDATA[#2... I got stuck on that one for ages. I was successfully creating static copies of every other site besides the one I wanted to! Thank very much for guide.

In case anyone is interested, another plugin that does static version creation for WP is really-static. It is a little finicky to setup but seems to do the job well. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/really-static/

In my case I want my static server to get the files rather than my WP install sending them, so wget is a better solution for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great script, thanks! My cheapo shared server was getting overloaded with light traffic.

Only problems I had were because I&#039;m running OSX, but a few minor changes fixed it:

- change all occurances of &quot;sed -r&quot; to &quot;sed -E&quot;
- fix path to mysql]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Quick heads up, you can have wget ignore the robots text with the &lt;code&gt;-e robots=off&lt;/code&gt; option, which is probably simpler than changing the site&#039;s robots / settings. The resulting HTML files might still contain the noarchive meta tags, which would make for a more consistent mirror of the original site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mossiso.com/2009/07/20/convert-wp-to-static-html-part-2/#comment-2488&quot;&gt;Audentes&lt;/a&gt;.

Audentes,

Sorry for the troubles. I would expect it would only take a half-hour or so for someone to run the script or commands to convert the WP install to static. They would need to make a copy of the database as well, if you wanted to save any of the plugin information. I&#039;m out of the loop on how much to charge for contract work, so I can&#039;t be much help there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello. 

DESPERATE TO GO STATIC ASAP:

The WordPress built-in editor randomly wipes out perfectly good code that had worked for several days. Suddenly, all corrupted. (Alternating blue-white table cells, alignment, all gone! -- and other things.)

I need to get out of WordPress. Is there any way to convert easily to a static site without losing all the stuff in my plugins?  

My pages are mostly empty or draft, but I don&#039;t want to lose my sidebar &#038; menu, and my video page image grid.

Could you suggest HOW LONG it would take someone experienced to convert this to STATIC?  And how much I should expect to pay for this - lowest end possible? I am very very limited in budget, which is why I was doing it all myself to start with.  Thanks.
