					<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=69e305481ae6b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;L. Tom Perry, “‘And Why Call Ye Me, Lord, Lord, and Do Not the Things Which I Say?’,” Ensign, Nov 1984, 17&lt;/a&gt;

Here is a good talk from L. Tom Perry. I like how he reminds us that ultimately it is keeping God&#039;s commandments that should concern us. The main factor for us is to be obedient. Keeping the commandment of the Sabbath is one easy way to be obedient. Some highlights from the talk:

&quot;With the proper planning, we should be able to use the Lord’s day in the way that He has intended for us.&quot;
This brings up the issue of &quot;the ox in the mire.&quot; This is actually a phrase somewhat limited to the Mormon culture. It stems from the account in Matthew 12: 10-13 and Luke 14: 1-6 where Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath. The question is asked (by the people in Matthew&#039;s account, and by Jesus in Luke&#039;s), &quot;Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?&quot; He responds to the question by asking them if any of them were to have an ox, donkey or sheep fall into a pit on the sabbath, would they not rush to pull it out? How much more worth is a man than a sheep? It is, therefore, lawful to do well on the sabbath day.

The principle to practice, here, is that it is good to do well. There may arise circumstances which are beyond your control where you may need to do something you normally wouldn&#039;t do on the sabbath. But as Elder Perry states, with proper planning, we should be able to do the Lord&#039;s will on the sabbath. The ox may fall in the mire, but we must not push him in. We must do all we can on the days before to make sure we can keep the sabbath day.

Elder Perry also reminds us that the sabbath was made for man, and that it is sacred.

&quot;From the scriptures, let us remember, “The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.” (Mark 2:27.) And again He has instructed us in the Doctrine and Covenants, “Trifle not with sacred things.” (D&amp;C 6:12.)&quot;]]></description>
