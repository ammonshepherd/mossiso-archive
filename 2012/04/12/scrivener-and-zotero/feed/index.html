(I know this is from 2012 but thought it could help)

I think the issue you are having is that you must highly some text (like the last word plus period or whatever) before clicking footnote, otherwise footnote is grayed out as an option. You don&#039;t have to do that with an inline footnote since that just turns on making whatever you type next an inline footnote.]]></description>

Hi chapeskie,

I found a couple of pages on the zotero website that should help with creating a bibliography:

http://www.zotero.org/support/creating_bibliographies

http://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration

The easiest way is to just select all of the items in Zotero, then export those in bibliography format to a new RTF file, then copy and paste that into your document. I&#039;m pretty sure the Zotero+Word plugin has the ability for bibliography creation built in, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to use Scrivner for writing my dissertation but have been unable to get Zotero to populate the bibliography as my other citation manager does (writencite+word), am I missing something? Using writencite (the plug-in for refworks online citation manger) I can insert a tag for a specific citation in the text and at the end of it all hit the bibliography button and it creates the full bibliography based on the tags found throughout the document. So useful! So far, however, I haven&#039;t found a way to do this with Zotero, any ideas?]]></description>

That&#039;s a great set up. Basically, write in scrivener -&gt; put citations in scrivener with zotero -&gt; export scrivener to RTF -&gt; convert RTF with zotero -&gt; final edits and tweaks in word processor. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

Janet, I thought Scrivener was a full trial, meaning all options were there, but I&#039;m not sure. I would pop over to the support forums for Scrivener and see if this question has been answered there. If not you can ask there. http://literatureandlatte.com/forum/search.php]]></description>
