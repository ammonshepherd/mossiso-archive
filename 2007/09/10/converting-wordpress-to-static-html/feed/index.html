					<description><![CDATA[My website has 6700 post which are made while wordpress permalink was set on default setting.  When I try to change permalink on post-name and using .htaccess by entering script as mentioned above it won&#039;t change my permalink structure. In fact links are all broken unless I switch back to default settings.
I&#039;m presently trying to convert this blog by running it on xampp.  Thanks for any idea how to proceed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a really simple way to do it without having to hack. If you have the theme Magazine basic I know it works. Go to Magazine Basic under appearance. Hit the Front Page tab. under number of posts insert 1.  Under excerpt or content, select content.  For some reason this sets up the front page and the rest of the pages as a static site ( : Hope it helps!]]></description>

There are a few plugins out there that can do it. I can&#039;t vouch for their quality or effectiveness. A quick google search turned up this one.

Yeah, that&#039;s kind of the point of turning your WordPress into a static page. The process is not so much for speed increase, but for security. If the site is not active anymore, then I turn it into plain HTML pages and it can&#039;t be hacked.]]></description>
