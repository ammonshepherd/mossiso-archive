					<description><![CDATA[I really want this to work because it loks like you put a lot of time into it and it could save me a lot of time. However, I am not getting the results I should. I have server stats working with extended on. I have links installed and netstat is working. I run ./atop and all I get is headings listed at the top &quot;Seconds  PID    CPU State TYPE         IP                  Domain/URL&quot; with the State Column Key below. There are no results shown but I have a ton of traffic right now that I am watching come through the apache logs.

Maybe it has something to do with Apache listening on 127.0.0.1 on port 8282 and Varnish caching server on port 80? I edited atop by searching and replacing localhost with &quot;admin.mysite.com&quot;. My stats are at http://admin.mystie.com/server-status and are working from any IP.

Ubuntu 16.04
Apache 2.4.18
Php 7.0
Varnish 4.1.1]]></description>
