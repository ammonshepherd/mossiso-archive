					<description><![CDATA[You said in your last sentence that there was a continuation of Sonderweg in East Germany, what evidence is there of this in terms of Foreign Policy?

I agree. There are always similarities and differences that one can make between any two countries. Deciding that one of them is the &quot;normal&quot; and the other is &quot;different&quot; only shows the bias of the one making the claim.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an interesting website.  As for the Sonderweg, the idea implies a &quot;Normalweg.&quot;  If the Normalweg is Great Britain, France, or the United States, then you have revolutions both social and political, civil wars, and wars of conquest.

I think that German history since 1750 is one variation on a theme that includes other unique variations.]]></description>
