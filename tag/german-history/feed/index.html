										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an essay I wrote for a Directed Readings course in Fall 2009, with Marion Deshmukh.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Sonderweg</em> of German History</strong></p>
<p>Before 1940s there was a positive <em>Sonderweg</em> thesis that promoted favorably the differences of Germany from other Western nations.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> This is similar to what every nation does, showing their best side, why they are better or, in a good sense, different than other nations.  These are typical self-promotion tactics that help one feel good with ones’ self, and to help others see the virtues they would like them to see.  This thesis is more appropriately termed the &#8220;German divergence from the West&#8221; in English.  <em>Sonderweg</em> was mainly a derogatory term used by its critics.</p>
<p>After 1940, the positive <em>Sonderweg</em> was no longer developed or used.  A critical <em>Sonderweg</em> took the place of the positive reflection of German history, with the new one attempting to answer one prominent question; How did Germany produce a society and political atmosphere where National Socialism could come to power?  Proponents of this <em>Sonderweg</em> thesis have been Ernst Fraenkel, Hans Rosenberg, George Mosse, Fritz Stern, Karl-Dietrich Bracher, Gerhard A.  Ritter, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Heinrich August Winkler, Helmut Plessner, Leonard Krieger, Kurt Sontheimer, John Maynard Keynes, Fritz Fischer, Wolfgang Mommsen.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Those who argued for a critical <em>Sonderweg</em> put forth the following points for seeing Germany’s special path to National Socialism.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sonderweg</em> proponents were cautious about asserting a &#8220;necessary relationship between long-term developments in German History and the triumph of National Socialism,” but in the end were specifically looking for peculiarities in German politics that hindered a liberal democracy from developing.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></li>
<li>Germany had a relatively late attempt at creating a nation state.  France and the United States of America formed, or attempted to form, a nation in the late eighteenth century.  It was nearly one hundred years, finally in 1871, that Germany was able to form a federal government.</li>
<li><em>Sonderweg</em> proponents hearken back to the <em>Kaiserreich</em> government’s oppressive practices that limited parliament and caused what parties that did form to be rigid and fragmented.</li>
<li>German defeat in World War I is seen as an important part of the German <em>Sonderweg</em>.  The devastating defeat in the First World War left German confidence in tatters.  Coupled with the limiting and demeaning restrictions of the Versailles Treaty, Germany seemed anxious to prove to themselves and Europeans that they were a nation of worth.  The defeat also led Germany into a new phase of government different, full parliamentary constitution with no monarchy or empire.</li>
<li>Germany&#8217;s political culture tended to be conservative.  This made it difficult for liberal parties to be effective.</li>
<li>The &#8220;Junkers-the large agrarian landowners east of the Elbe River&#8221; (similar to the English gentry) retained much of their power.  Whereas other nations had developed a parliament with representative leaders, much of Germany’s power still lay with landed aristocrats.</li>
<li>Bismarck&#8217;s forming the nation-state with &#8220;Blut und Eisen&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;blood and iron&#8221; which put emphasis on the military, and left them unchecked by parliament.  This gave a militaristic approach to German government that lasted through the Weimar Republic and into National Socialism.</li>
<li>The unbourgeois-ness of the bourgeoisie.  They never really revolted against the aristocratic society and political culture.  There was no middle class of people to rise up in rebellion as there were in other Western states.  As a result Germany was left without a tradition of successful revolutions and a history of top-down reforms.  Combined with pressure from the peasants, the middle classes were politically weak.</li>
<li>Germany experienced a strange mixture of social and economic modernization and industrialization and capitalism on one hand, but maintained the old power relations, pre-industrial institutions, and cultures.  It was an odd combination of old powers, cultures and organizations in charge of new social and economic conditions and ways of production.</li>
<li>All of these &#8220;long-term patterns&#8221; came to a head with the &#8220;short-term factors&#8221; of 1920s and 1930s, and help to explain the collapse of the Weimar Republic and rise of National Socialism.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;In a nutshell, the critical <em>Sonderweg</em> thesis claimed to indentify long-term structures and processes that, under the influence of numerous other factors (from the consequences of defeat in World War I through the class conflicts of the 1920s to the peculiarities of Adolf Hitler&#8217;s personality), contributed to the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the triumph of National Socialism&#8221;.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Historians opposed or critical of the <em>Sonderweg</em> have based their critiques partly on methodology.  Opponents to the <em>Sonderweg</em> thesis have been Thomas Nipperdey, David Blackbourn, Geoff Eley, Ernst Nolte, Jürgen Kocka, François Furet,Friedrich Meinecke.</p>
<p>Their opposition consists of the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are several historical continuities to be seen in German history.  For example the <em>Kaiserreich</em> is also a prehistory of the Federal Republic of Germany.  This line of reasoning suggests that as National Socialism fades farther into the past, it becomes less of a clear case that the collapse of the Weimar Republic led to National Socialism.  Supporting a <em>Sonderweg</em> assumes there is a &#8220;normal path&#8221; that Germany could have taken.  To define what a &#8220;normal&#8221; path is, is much to subjective a &#8220;value judgment,&#8221; and the belief in the superiority of &#8220;the West&#8221;.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></li>
<li>A research in Bielefeld has shown that the aristocratic influence (or dominance) over the middle class was no greater in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Germany than in other western European nations.  International comparisons have shown, contrary to <em>Sonderweg</em> hypothesis, that the educated German middle class was &#8220;strong and clearly contoured&#8221;.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> It was a widespread European trait for the bourgeois to turn from liberalism in nineteenth century.</li>
<li>The <em>Kaiserreich</em> did show signs of modernism.  It was &#8220;full of modern dynamism, for example in the areas of science and scholarship, art and culture&#8221;.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></li>
<li>Intensive recent research seems to point to National Socialism as a modern phenomenon, rather than the results of past traditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some core aspects of the <em>Sonderweg</em> have been supported, though, through recent research in three ways:</p>
<p>1.     Three of the basic developmental problems of modern societies showed themselves at the same time only in Germany.  1) Formation of the nation-state, 2) decision to have a constitution (parliament) or no, 3) issues with society brought by industrialization.  Other countries dealt with these individually, that is, with generations, or at least decades, of time in between to iron out difficulties.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>2.     While issues with the middle class, the bourgeoisie, cannot be discounted, they did have less of an effect on Germany society than in other European countries.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>3.     Germany had a &#8220;bureaucratic tradition&#8221; of a strong authoritarian state.  Such power in the hands of the state blocked parliament from functioning, provided effective services to the people, and weakened middle class liberalism.  When a democratic government finally did have power, after World War I in the form of the Weimar Republic, the inability of the leaders to provide a stable economy and society meant Germans were eager, or at least willing, to go back to a strong authoritarian state.  Important to realize, though, is that the rise of National Socialism should be seen separate from the fall of the Weimar Republic.  National Socialism was too new to have broken apart the Weimar Republic; it merely picked up the pieces.</p>
<p>With the Federal Republic the <em>Sonderweg</em> ended for West Germany.  It became a &#8220;normal&#8221; western nation.  East Germany, continued the <em>Sonderweg</em>, much altered of course, until its collapse in 1989-90.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whew! That was fun. Marion Deschmuk, Dina Copelman, and Sean Takats are great faculty to work with. And I would not have been able to do it without the mentoring of Steve Barnes this semester. Also, it wouldn&#8217;t be possible without the support of my wonderful wife Jessica, and the prayers and encouragement from family! Only two more hurdles to go, prospectus in December will put me at ABD (all but dissertation), and then the simple matter of research and writing a dissertation.</p>
<p>To finish off these posts about the orals, I&#8217;m posting some images of documents I made to help me conceptualize the books in their proper time periods. It&#8217;s basically back to the notecard system and arranging them chronologically. Each &#8220;card&#8221; has the title, a list of themes, a note about sources, and the main thesis of the book. This was extremely helpful in getting a grasp of the books. I created these in a Mac application called <a title="OmniGraffle" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/" target="_blank">OmniGraffle</a>. What would be even cooler, though, is if Zotero had a way to create this type of notecard type display with the ability to drag and drop the cards to organize in themes or chronologically.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met with my Dissertation adviser last week, and we decided that the topic I had picked really had nothing to do with my dissertation. I don&#8217;t know why, but I had always been afraid to just bite off a chunk of the dissertation and give that a go. But after talking with Prof. Deshmukh, it should be quite doable.</p>
<figure id="attachment_388" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-388" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium  wp-image-388 " title="Albert-Speer-72-929" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415-240x300.jpg 240w, wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415-250x311.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415-120x150.jpg 120w, wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-388" class="wp-caption-text">Albert Speer at Nuremburg Trials. Image from Wikimedia Commons.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So the dissertation is the Nazi tunnels, and this paper will be an important part of that. One of the two organizations that looked into, and actually built some of the planned tunnels was the Reichsministerium für Rüstung und Kreigsproduktion (RMfRuK, Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production). This group was headed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Speer">Albert Speer</a>, who incidentally was a very interesting man. Anyhow, my paper will now look at the Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production. It will kind of be an historical overview of the organization and several key players in the building of the tunnels.</p>
<p>As we were discussing each others papers in class last night, the question kept coming around to what is the so what question, or why is this important for us to know. I went last, so we were all ready to just get out of class, and we didn&#8217;t really get to that part of mine. Which I&#8217;m kind of glad for, since I don&#8217;t really have one. Why is this important for us to know? Because it helps us understand the tunnel? Does that work?</p>
<p>At any rate, such is my new topic, it applies directly to my dissertation, and will be part of a chapter that discusses the organizations involved in building the tunnels.</p>
<figure id="attachment_393" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-393" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-393" title="800px-US_National_Archives_II" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-300x221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-300x221.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-250x184.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-150x110.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-624x460.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-393" class="wp-caption-text">US National Archives at College Park. Image from Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure>
<p>This, of course, means that all of my sources and bibliography need to be redone. I was a bit worried about sources, which is probably why I didn&#8217;t want to do the topic. Well, it turns out that Prof. Deshmukh has copies of the indexes to the Guides to German Records Microfilmed at Alexandria, VA, which are the captures Nazi documents housed at the U.S. National Archives. It just so happens that there are over 1000 rolls of microfilm that reference the RMfRuk (with over 190 being the records of this organization directly)! What a find. Now my extra hours will be spent going over the hundreds of pages of the indexes looking for references to Speer, Himmler, Kammler and tunnels. And then it&#8217;s off to the National Archives in College Park, Maryland to look at the actual documents. I have a lot to do before the April 12 deadline of the first draft (which should be as complete as possible).</p>
<p>So, if you didn&#8217;t get it yet, here are the steps to doing such a research paper:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an interesting topic. It has to hold your attention, or you will be miserable.</li>
<li>Talk to your Professors. They&#8217;ll point you on the right track for all kinds of things (sources, topic focus, secondary literature, encouragement, etc).</li>
<li>Find the sources. Best is to find an index or something that describes the sources. For my example, before I even go to the National Archives, I will have a list of specific rolls of microfilm I need, with particular documents I want to look at on the films. Hopefully my bank account can sustain the copies needed, or better yet, I&#8217;ll be able to make digital copies.</li>
<li>Find secondary literature about any aspect of your topic. In my case I need books and articles about Albert Speer, the RMfRuk, Nazi organizations, industrial and economic studies of Nazi Germany, etc.</li>
<li>Look the the secondary material for insights, information, and most importantly, more sources. I&#8217;m now see how important footnotes are, and can see what resources are most often used, what works are most often cited, and who makes what arguments. Harvesting the footnotes for sources is integral in historical research.</li>
<li>Gather information from primary and secondary sources and make an outline of the argument.</li>
<li>Write, write, write, and then do some more writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I am back to step 3, finding the sources. I&#8217;m going to the Archives on Friday. Wish me luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_382" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-382" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02767r.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-382 " title="Library of Congress - John Adams Building" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02767r-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02767r-300x228.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02767r-250x190.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02767r-150x114.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02767r-624x475.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2010/02/02767r.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-382" class="wp-caption-text">Library of Congress - John Adams Building</figcaption></figure>
<p>So I finally went to the Library of Congress for actual archival research. They have about ten years worth of the &#8216;Kosmos&#8217; magazine from 1919-1927 that I will look at for my paper. It was really fun. The whole family went down. Jess and I both got new LoC cards, then they went to a museum and I went to read old books.</p>
<p>Up until this point my big worry had been in finding some primary documents. Now that I have them, I don&#8217;t know what to do with them. I proposed this dilemma to the class last night and they had some great ideas on how to use the source. I also have a great article to use as a template, in that the historian, Nick Hopwood, looks at the &#8216;Urania&#8217; magazine used by the socialists in Weimar Germany. (Nick Hopwood, “Producing a Socialist Popular Science in the Weimar Republic,” <span style="font-style: italic;">History Workshop Journal</span>, no. 41 (Spring 1996): 117-153.)</p>
<p>Reading this article is my goal for tonight&#8217;s short two hour study session. I&#8217;m planning on going back to the LoC on Thursday to get some more data. But here are the ideas my classmates had:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at a particular author that continually prints</li>
<li>look at one science/tech, follow how Nazi magazines and others treat  the topic</li>
<li>look at old and new to see if they deal with a subject</li>
<li>what happened to the authors of the socialist papers</li>
<li>study what kind of articles are being printed, what topics come up  continually</li>
<li>what happened to the authors/editors of the socialist papers, did  they go to Dachau, were the scientists who published put to work in  their fields?</li>
<li>narrow down the so what question. What question are you trying to  answer, that will help you know what to look for in the sources.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-383" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5-adams.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-383" title="Library of Congress - John Adams Building - 5th floor" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5-adams-300x249.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="249" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5-adams-300x249.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5-adams-250x208.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5-adams-150x124.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2010/02/5-adams.jpg 485w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-383" class="wp-caption-text">Library of Congress - John Adams Building - 5th floor</figcaption></figure>
<p>What the issue really boils down to is that I need to narrow my topic. I can&#8217;t have my topic be &#8216;science and technology in Weimar Germany&#8217;. That&#8217;s way too broad. Too broad for a dissertation, even. I like the idea of focusing on one particular science or technology, and see how it is portrayed throughout the Weimar Republic, and even into post-Weimar Germany. Ideally, it aligns with my dissertation topic of Nazi tunnels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In class last night we discussed what makes up a historical scholarly paper. To jump start our thinking processes and enhance our observation skills, we were to compare two essays, one provided by the professor, and the other one applicable to our papers.</p>
<p>This was a great exercise to help me figure out the structure of a scholarly paper. As we discussed in class, here are the common conventions in a scholarly paper as written in an historical journal. A good historical scholarly paper usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>opens with a catchy anecdote, quote, narrative, etc. This livens up the essay, provides a good basis for framing the time period, etc.</li>
<li>discusses the most relevant historiography</li>
<li>discusses the &#8220;So What?&#8221; question. Addresses why the article is worth reading. Provides a clear statement of the problem.</li>
<li>provides a clear statement of the thesis.</li>
<li>lays out the the themes and structure of article in the beginning so it is easy to follow.</li>
<li>discusses methodology. This includes a discussion of primary sources; organizing the sources, what to expect out of them, address the limits and strengths of primary sources (who wrote them, what was their purpose).</li>
<li>uses footnotes. Footnotes can be an integral part of a historical paper. Footnotes can be used to discuss other arguments not directly related to the thesis. They establish credibility by showing that the author knows more than just their narrow topic. Footnotes are a way of establishing legitimacy and knowledge of the subject and other tangential subjects. They can be a means to deflect possible criticism by addressing issues other historians would most likely raise. Footnotes can also build bridges to understanding by referencing other areas, or providing examples. If there are a bunch of letters, newspaper articles, etc., quote a couple in the text, but then to show there is more than just the two, do a &#8220;see also&#8221;, or reference that you read many more sources, in a footnote.</li>
<li>has a length of 20-25 pages of text.</li>
<li>has a format consisting of an intro, a body divided into three sections and a conclusion.</li>
<li>has reference to the most prevalent historians in the field, and includes their articles/books in the footnotes as a reference. They just might be the ones reviewing your essay, and if they see their works referenced, they  might be more likely to approve yours for publishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it. Some easy guidelines for writing a historical scholarly article for a journal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I needed to rethink my proposal for my paper. The comments I got back were &#8220;too vague,&#8221; &#8220;too broad,&#8221; &#8220;need focus,&#8221; and &#8220;what aspect.&#8221; Yeah, I knew that already. But when you write the new proposal 30 minutes before you turn it in, and 10 minutes after you think it up&#8230; well, it don&#8217;t look pretty.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve had some more time to think about my topic, and have searched for sources, and I think I have a better grasp on what to do.</p>
<figure id="attachment_214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-214" title="Horton 2-29" alt="" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-214" class="wp-caption-text">Reconstructed Horton 2-29</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now the paper will be on science and technology in the Weimar period. More specifically, I&#8217;ll look at how popular, political and scientific attitudes about science and technology influenced German leaders going into World War II. Germany had some pretty incredible technology in World War II. They had the first jet aircraft, the first ballistic missile, and this awesome airplane (<a href="http://historicalwebber.mossiso.com/nazis-in-the-news-211.html">I have posted about before</a>)!</p>
<p>I also found an <a href="http://web.ebscohost.com.mutex.gmu.edu/ehost/detail?vid=1&amp;hid=107&amp;sid=3817a2be-ffde-4700-9c0b-c6517e73cc8a%40sessionmgr110&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&amp;AN=H001298113.01">interesting quote</a> from Hitler, where he supposedly said &#8220;Germany&#8217;s technology, industry, and morale were sufficient to fight an indefinite war.&#8221; So was there something in the Weimar period that lead Hitler to believe this. Certainly he did, as did the scientists and researchers who were so innovative.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;ll come up with a better one paragraph proposal, and I might feel comfortable enough about it to post it. And now it&#8217;s on to find sources (primary and secondary) about popular, political, and from the field itself, attitudes about science and technology in Weimar Germany! I&#8217;ll start by looking in the field of aviation, since that is my passion, if I have such a thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not that I really have time to blog as I do it, but&#8230; I feel like I need to do something historical here&#8230; So why not.</p>
<figure id="attachment_358" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-358" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-358" title="Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Markirch-A9-Scan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-358" class="wp-caption-text">Tunnel at Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (German: Markirch), in Alsace, France</figcaption></figure>
<p>So this is my last class before embarking on my dissertation. The Graduate Research Seminar should hopefully tie up any loose knots in our historical writing abilities. It&#8217;s a course on honing our skills. The syllabus looks great, and I&#8217;m excited for the class. One initial question I had was, why are we learning how to write like historians until the very end? Why don&#8217;t we learn how to write at the beginning or even in the middle? Well, there is a course or two on that, but nothing like this one proposes to be. We&#8217;re apparently going to learn all the behind-the-scene techniques and tricks to the trade. I&#8217;m actually really excited for it. Our Professor is great.</p>
<p>So for this class we&#8217;re supposed to write a 25-30 page paper that will hopefully become a chapter (or at least a bulk of one) of the dissertation. If nothing else, it can be a publishable paper. On the very low end, it will at least teach us something we don&#8217;t want to do for a dissertation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_357" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-357" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-357" title="Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Map-B-Group-Scan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-357" class="wp-caption-text">Map of tunnel locations</figcaption></figure>
<p>My dissertation, as it stands now, is on Nazi Tunnels. The Nazis, towards the middle of the war, decided that they needed to move much of their war manufacturing underground. So they designed and built huge underground bunkers and tunnel systems for factories and depots. Go ahead, google it. There&#8217;s not much out there. Add the keywords, &#8216;melk ebensee&#8217; and you&#8217;ll get a few more responses. The only scholarly works that I know of on this topic are two German books. One is an excellent work by Hans Walter Wichert, <em>Decknamenverzeichnis deutscher unterirdischer Bauten</em>(at <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Decknamenverzeichnis-deutscher-unterirdischer-zweiten-Weltkrieges/dp/3980327140/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264723732&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon</a>, already have one), which lists practically all of the underground building sites during Nazi Germany. The second work is a dissertation by Bertrand Perz, <em>Projekt Quarz: Steyr-Daimler-Puch Und Das Konzentrationslager Melk, Industrie, Zwangsarbeit und Konzentrationslager in O?sterreich</em> (<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Das-Konzentrationslager-Melk-Steyr-Daimler-Puch-Projekt/dp/3706541858/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264723686&amp;sr=8-1">at Amazon</a> if anyone wants to buy it for me), which is an in-depth look at one of these underground projects in Melk, Australia.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there are totally no sources available, to my knowledge, that I can use for the current project. That&#8217;s part of my dissertation work, is to dig up all of those sources. It should be fun. It&#8217;s also not manageable in a semester&#8217;s time. So for this semester&#8217;s project I had several ideas.</p>
<figure id="attachment_359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-359 " title="ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ProjektQuarzScan-080303-0001-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359" class="wp-caption-text">Projekt Quarz</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, I thought about doing a micro-study on just one of the tunnels. Unfortunately, in the two or three hours of looking for sources, I couldn&#8217;t find any. I haven&#8217;t checked with the library, yet, but I&#8217;m not hopeful. So my second idea is to look at a more broad topic that touches the issue of the tunnels. One obvious one is, why did they build them in the first place (the answer is to protect them from Allied bombings). But a deeper question begs, why did they think they could do that in the first place. It was a huge undertaking to move so many factories underground. They must have though they could do it. So a deeper question would be, why did the Nazi&#8217;s think they could undertake such a big job. Now let&#8217;s step back a bit, say, 30-50 years, and apply this question to Germany as a whole in the form of, what did German&#8217;s think of their technical and scientific abilities? So that will be my basis of inquiry for this semester&#8217;s project. I will look at what German citizens, German scientists, and German politicians thought about German science and technology from 1900 until the end of World War II. I post more on this as I think it through and find sources.</p>
<p>So, basically, I&#8217;m hoping to keep up the blog as I write the paper and take the class. I&#8217;ll post the methodology that I learn, and the troubles and trials, the triumphs and tackles about writing a historical paper.</p>
<p>First off, I feel completely unprepared because I have no sources. That&#8217;s the first thing to tackle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I almost forgot for this week, but found some stuff today, so here goes&#8230;.</p>
<p>And a small disclaimer, or explanation first. Instead of just making this a list of cool stuff out there, I&#8217;m going to try to tie it into the field of history or academia.  That will get me to think a bit more and hopefully stay true to my desires to have this blog about history and new media.</p>
<p>So&#8230; First off we have a couple of gadgets, of the software kind:</p>
<p><img src='http://historicalwebber.mossiso.com/files/2008/03/paintbrush.png' alt='paintbrush' /><br />
Gadget #1: <a href="http://paintbrush.sourceforge.net/">Paintbrush. [Mac only]</a> Have you ever wanted to just make a quick drawing or picture in Mac. It&#8217;s not that easy without Paintbrush. It gives Mac users a semblance of Microsoft Paint.  Now, what&#8217;s the application to history, et al.? Ummm&#8230; I don&#8217;t know either. I&#8217;ll get a strike for this one&#8230;</p>
<p><img src='http://historicalwebber.mossiso.com/files/2008/03/skitch.png' alt='skitch' /><br />
Gadget #2: Skitch.com This is a new service that allows you to quickly take an image and annotate, draw, and share.  You can grab photos from your iPhoto library, take screen shots, or import images.  When you&#8217;re done drawing and such, you can upload it to your own account on skitch.com and share your photos. Check out my test photo at <a href="http://skitch.com/mossiso/">http://skitch.com/mossiso/</a> This might come in handy as another way for historians to share photos and their ideas. A teacher could upload some images and draw specific things&#8230; yeah, it&#8217;s a stretch too.</p>
<p>Tip #1: <a href="http://archives.gov/research/tools/index.html">US National Archives Research Online</a> and the <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/research/collections/search/">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>. OK, OK, here&#8217;s a real tip for the historians. I&#8217;ve been looking for some information on the &#8220;Quarz&#8221; project started by the Nazis in late 1944.  There is supposedly some photos at the National Archives, but I haven&#8217;t found them yet. I was tipped off to this topic by a friend and co-PhD student at GMU who works at USHMM. She knew of some nice had drawn maps that relate to project Quarz. So I took some digital copies of these maps, and want to use them in a project this semester.  The above linked resources help in searching for documents, images, etc.</p>
<p>Well, the tips, tricks, gadgets and goodies were a bit lacking this week. Enjoy what you can of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was in high school, my friends and I would go down to the Salt River, tie one end of a ski rope to a tree, and the other end to our home made river boards.  These were generally three foot diameter circular pieces of plywood, carefully and lovingly designed, painted and created by me and my friends.  We&#8217;d throw the board into the middle of the river (this used in the broadest sense of the term, since Arizona isn&#8217;t too well known for flowing bodies of water), jump on and ride the current.  We&#8217;d jump the board and do tricks like head stands, hand stands, back flips, etc. It was the source of very fond memories.</p>
<p>Well, imagine my surprise, when looking up some information about Wernher von Braun for a school paper today, and here he is, &#8220;water-boarding&#8221; in the middle of the Tennessee River!  Wernher von Braun, enigmatic rocket man! Creator of the U.S. missile and space program!  Rocket genius! and River Boarder! Awesome!</p>

<p>The seller has to sell them in Britain because Nazi memorabilia is illegal in Germany.</p>
