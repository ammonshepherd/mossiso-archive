										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, so much for doing this weekly. But here&#8217;s another go at it!</p>
<p><a href="http://prezi.com"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-165" title="Prezi.com" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-1.png" alt="Prezi.com" width="142" height="55" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-1.png 290w, wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-1-250x95.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-1-150x57.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px" /></a>For making some pretty snazy presentations, or graphical representations of data, you can use <a title="Prezi" href="http://prezi.com/" target="_blank">http://prezi.com/</a> From their site: &#8220;With the help of Prezi you can create maps of texts, images, videos, PDFs, drawings and present in a nonlinear way.  Move beyond the slide, it only takes 5 minutes to learn how to use Prezi.&#8221; I imagine this being very useful for historians as a way to visualize their narrative. Move from quote to image to video to audio. You could take a book and condense it down into a 10 minute presentation, using appropriate quotes, some images, and movies if you got em. A good way to introduce a topic, I would think. Perhaps I&#8217;ll throw together something and post it back later.</p>
<p><a href="http://quietube.com"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-171" title="quietube" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-2.png" alt="quietube" width="147" height="54" /></a>Quietube &#8211; send links to youtube, but without all of the comments, ads, and other videos to clutter and distract. When you visit a youtube video, just click the quietube link you previously added to your bookmarks folder. All of the distractions vanish!</p>
<p><a href="http://bkkeepr.com"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-174" title="bkkeepr" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-3.png" alt="bkkeepr" width="167" height="48" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-3.png 299w, wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-3-250x71.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-3-150x42.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px" /></a>An interesting way to let others know where you are in a book, and which books you are reading. You can use it for yourself too, if you don&#8217;t have one of those old fashioned paper book marks.From their site: &#8220;<span class="logo">bkkeepr</span> lets you track your reading and bookmark on the go, via the web and SMS. Want to remember what you read? Want to share your dog-eared pages, and see what everyone else dog-eared? Love LibraryThing, but are always forgetting to add your books? <span class="logo">bkkeepr</span> helps you do it, wherever you are.&#8221; So, basically, a way to let a website keep track of what books you&#8217;re reading and where you are in the books, made simple by sending a quick SMS.</p>
