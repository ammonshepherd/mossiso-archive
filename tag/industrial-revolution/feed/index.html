										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will invariably get a few questions about how I would teach modern European history as a professor. To prepare for these types of questions I wrote down (actually, I typed them all in, no pencil or paper used <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) the three nations I&#8217;m looking at and some themes, events, and books I would like to use in a course. I struggled with which people, if any to focus on.</p>
<p>A theoretical question I could be asked is: Say you have to teach a course on (Modern England, Modern France, Modern Germany, Modern Europe, World Wars in Europe, etc). What themes, events, people would you focus on and what books would you include? What would be the layout of the course?</p>
<p>I focus on individual countries below, and for a general European course, I would just draw from each of the countries. The books I pull from are only the ones on my Orals reading list. I would most likely supplement with other books after doing some research if I were really teaching a course.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that I probably would never just go chronologically through a time period to hit big events and &#8220;important&#8221; people. History is very subjective. We look back on events and information with a certain set of &#8220;filters&#8221; on. For example we view Germany with political filters, focusing on governments and politicians. Or we may focus on France with cultural filters, looking at food, society, entertainment and arts. It&#8217;s impossible to get a <em>full</em> picture or sense of the past. Just as it&#8217;s impossible to gain a full sense of the present. There&#8217;s just too many people, too many viewpoints, too many sides to the same story, and too many filters to encompass everything. What&#8217;s the point, then? The point is to do what we can. Find what interests you and study the past through that filter. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with learning about one slice of the pie, as long as we don&#8217;t think our slice represents the whole thing. With that said, then, I would probably pick a few themes and have the books, discussions and (unless totally unavoidable) lectures focus on those themes. See the very bottom of this post for a couple of teaching ideas.</p>

<p>Hazareesingh: Argues that concepts of citizenship and a weaker state  government were first established during Second Empire, rather than in  Third Republic. Sources based on elite writings, so it shows what they  wanted, not necessarily what happened, since there was much restriction  of local governments and individual rights.</p>
<p>Nord: Unique way of looking at how Third Republic lasted so long, not  how it could end in Vichy. Shows how Third Republic implemented  political ideas that Hazareesingh shows the Second Empire wanted to use  (decentralized govt., create sense of citizenship, etc). Shows building  of &#8220;traditional&#8221; Victorian ideals about gender, public/private spheres,  middle-class bourgeois life shaped by and influenced politics in France.</p>
<p>McManners: to show the decline in religion, the issues of church and state (infalibility of pope)</p>
<p>Forth (or other book on Dreyfus Affair): Discuss why Dreyfus Affair  was so influential in France and elsewhere. The issues of antisemitism  in places other than Germany, and the masculinity complex in France and  Europe.</p>
<p>Prochaska: To show importance of colonies, especially Algeria, to  France. Stresses that Algeria was France, so issues there were similar  to issues in France. Perhaps also read with Horne about the Algerian  wars and end of France occupation to show the story from occupied and  occupiers.</p>
<p>Weber: Show the interwar years as decisive in France allowing Nazis so much influence in France.</p>
<p>Paxton and Rousso: Show the involvement of Vichy with Nazis, and the national conundrum that places on French narrative.</p>
<p>Hecht: To address the issue of France dealing with their national  image and turning to technology and technocrats as the source of  narrative building.</p>

<h3>Teaching Ideas</h3>
<p><strong>History Filters</strong></p>
<p>Study  of history is always dependent upon the &#8220;filter&#8221; through which you want  to look at it. It would be fun to divide the class into sections, and  each group take a specific &#8220;filter&#8221; (gender, culture, politics, economy,  class, race, etc). Each group either gets their own reading list or  they have to pull the specific themes from a general list. Then each  class period, each group takes a turn discussing history viewed through  their filter. Have the other groups not presenting write one question  before class and one question after for the presenting group to answer  about their &#8220;filter.&#8221; (Questions could be done on a blog.)</p>
<p><strong>Timelines</strong></p>
<p>Have students make a timeline of the time period the class will be    studying. Then in the first lecture share what my points are and argue    them. Have the students keep their timeline throughout the semester.    They will argue their points, especially if they change them, taking    ideas from the texts. Final paper is a well argued timeline.</p>

It most often encompasses  development and use of mechanical technology, a change in gender roles,  a real or perceived rise in standard of living, adjustments in social  classes, and, often, political change. Modernization at times was seen  in different ways including: a detriment to human society, a marvelous  improvement to society, an effect of economic and political challenges,  and, most recently, as an inevitable evolution of progress.</p>

<p>Modernism in England can be seen in all these ways in the nineteenth  century. The Industrial Revolution, as pointed out by E. P. Thompson had  a great impact on the social and economic status of the poor as whole  industries turned to machines in factories and entire occupations (think  weavers) were discontinued. Formation of factory unions lead to a  politically emboldened populace. The Victorian period is known for the  ideals of separate spheres for men (political, public, and occupational)  and women (private, nurturing) that are still observed and discussed  and contested to this day. As Robert Wohl writes, these Victorian ideals  are what caused many young individuals (in England, France and Germany)  during the turn of the century to question the role of authority and  the place of such ideals. English technological modernism during the  19th century was hampered by the desire of the business classes to  emulate the aristocracy. Martin Wiener writes that this English  pastoralism affected the economy by not allowing it to grow as in other  countries. Another form of modernist government was seen in England as  Parliament enacted many laws that directly interfered with individuals.  Laws governing the poor, woman&#8217;s rights, education, and voting abilities  all showed, for better or worse, a government with more interest in  their citizens.</p>

<p>If modernization is characterized primarily by use of technology,  especially of an industrial revolution, then Germany got off to a late  start comparatively. But following the unification and  industrialization in late 19th Century, Germany showed great progress.  Advances in aviation with Zeppelin, in art with the Bauhaus movement are  just two of the many examples. Politically Germany changed from a group  of loosely connected principalities to become a federated nation with,  albeit very weak, parliamentary government. At the turn of the century,  German youth were struggling with the sense of modernism and formed many  youth groups to express concern with political and social issues.  Germany showed a peculiar sense of modernization during the Third Reich.  Whereas Nazi ideology extolled the life of the peasant, the simple life  of the Volk, seemingly anti-modern, they still exhibited very modern  practices. The building of the Autobahns, the development of the first  ballistic missile, the successful flights of the first jet powered  aircraft were all seemingly contradictory to basic Nazi ideology.</p>

<p>During  the bifurcation years, West Germany enjoyed the status of a  technologically advanced and modern country. East Germany suffered the  stigma of a backwards and inept Soviet satellite country, incapable of  keeping up with modern technologies. Stokes shows, though, that East  Germany maintained technical competence through the length of its  existence (longer than the Third Reich, Weimar Republic and Imperialism,  a testament to a successful country with successful technologies such  as the Trabant, optics, and computers. What didn&#8217;t work in East Germany  was the political desire to keep up with western technology, but the  ineptness at maintaining a supportive economy, due in part to Soviet  inability or unwillingness to support East German technologies. East  Germany, in effect, sought to specialize in the fringe technologies of  the west, but did not have the underlying infrastructure to support  them.</p>

<p>Modernization in the political sense has been attributed to  the French Revolution. Changes between monarchies (and empires) to  republics throughout the early 19th century sparked the social and  political movements in Europe towards self-governed people (something  which the nobility and educated classes thought undesirable and  potentially devastating). As the Second Empire moved into the Third  Republic, self-government began in earnest, as national governments  allowed local governments more control. National governments also became  more interested in the individual citizens, much the same as in  England, as they enacted laws restricting religion and regulating  education. As always a factor, the Dreyfus Affair showed a nation  struggling with the society and the ideals that came out of political  change. Continual losses (Franco-Prussian, WWI and WWII) to Germany and  colonial troubles led France to desperately look towards modern  technology, such as nuclear power, to regain international standing, and  create a positive national narrative.</p>

<p>Imperialism in Britain prior to 1857 was to provide wealth to England. After Indian Mutiny in 1857, crown took over East India Company to help England, India, and Co survive. Afterward, they realized their dependence on their colonies and attitudes turned from one of master to one of public servant (there to enlighten India in economics, politics, and education). The realization of their dependence on colonies and their new focus on their relationship with colonies was termed &#8220;new Imperialism&#8221;. Porter and Hobsbawm both put economics as the moving force behind imperialism.</p>
<p>Another impetus for imperialism was the shift in local and national economics to the growing global market economy spawned by industrialist and capitalist needs for goods and resources. Imperialism became a necessity to remain competitive in the global market. If you didn&#8217;t have colonies to supply resources and goods, you didn&#8217;t have global power.</p>
<p>At a time of the rise in sciences of religion, New Imperialism was seen as social Darwinism as the more advanced, developed, and intelligent races naturally ruled over the lower species.</p>
<p>The Boer Wars in South Africa in 1850s and 1890s were significant shocks to Britain as they realized they were not the only players in the global bid for colonies, and, as they discovered in the second war, their nation was virtually unfit to compete in the skirmishes necessary to retain power.</p>

<p>Imperialism creates what Edward Said terms orientalism, or dividing humanity based on culture, and comes about as one country comes to terms with differences encountered in other countries. The universal issues of &#8220;us&#8221; versus &#8220;them&#8221;. Such encounters, especially after their defeat in the 1890 Second Boer War, and the discovery of unfit men, left England seriously questioning the beliefs and culture that led them to that point.</p>
<p>Gender also came to prominent status as mass media and upper classes turned to look at the lower classes and themselves. According to the way some authors (Koven and Walkowitz) portray Victorian society, every aspect of life was actually about sex. Walkowitz looks at how changes in the city brought changes in society and gender spheres. Victorian society became more accepting of sexual discourse through various mass media (mostly newspapers) as more people became literate.</p>
<figure id="attachment_724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-724" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-724" alt="Too much for him!" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism-300x207.jpg" width="300" height="207" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism-300x207.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism-250x172.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism-150x103.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism.jpg 546w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-724" class="wp-caption-text">Too much for him!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Such publicity lead to more exposure to woman&#8217;s rights and needs, as well as abuses (Jack the Ripper) and disreputable employments (prostitution). Some legal changes, including the Married Woman&#8217;s Property Act 1882, gave women more legal power to deal with injustices of the times. Koven looks at the philanthropic movement of &#8220;slumming,&#8221; the practice of upper class individuals visiting the poorest areas of cities in order to observe and often to help. Koven seems obsessed with the sexual aspects of everything, and seems to turn every instance into an opportunity to talk about it. Much too much focused on just one aspect to deliver a clear picture of Victorian period philanthropy. Anyhow, the Victorian period, especially fin de-siecle, was one of dramatic increase in the political address of woman&#8217;s rights.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<h3>How did the Industrial Revolution affect British society and politics?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-500" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-500" title="Steam Engine" alt="" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-300x228.jpg" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-300x228.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-250x190.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-150x114.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-624x475.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1.jpg 656w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-500" class="wp-caption-text">Steam Engine.

<h4>Changes in Lower Classes</h4>
<p>As E.P. Thompson&#8217;s book title suggests, the Industrial Revolution created a new socially aware and politically active group, or class of people. And it created more than one. E.P. focuses on the worker class that was established as people became workers in factories. The Industrial Revolution also created a new middle class of merchants and businessmen.</p>
<p>Industrial Revolution also changed trades. The weavers were the hardest hit. Once a respectable and well paid trade, after industry replaced people with machines, weaver trade was poorly paid and dishonorable. Positions opened up for women and children to work in factories. People moved to more urban areas. F.M.L. Thompson argues though, that these modes of urbanization were already in place and were not affected by industrialization.</p>
<p>This bespeaks a fear seen in all levels of society: the fear of change, the fear of technology, the dominance of machine over man.</p>
<h4>Organizations Lead to Political Activism</h4>
<p>This working class eventually formed unions to deal with issues in the factories, and such organization and collaboration in factory politics spilled out into the politics of government as they eventually sought redresses with Parliament. Dorothy Thompson writes about such a movement known as Chartism, that happened in the 1830s and 1840s. Chartism was a movement of varying and differing causes, with the intent of a better society, fueled by the long unhappy workingmen throughout the country.</p>
<h4>Middle Class Changes in Society</h4>
<p>The middle classes created their own sphere in English society. Wanting to emulate the aristocracy, they embraced the idea of the gentleman and created a culture of private and public spheres for women and men, codes of conduct and beliefs. Industry began a continual decent in the late nineteenth century as the middle class (the owners of industrial factories, the merchants and businessmen) abandon capitalist notions and seek the leisurely life of the gentleman. One argument is that the decline in British industrialism was a direct result of the middle class emulating the aristocracy instead of overcoming them (socially and politically) (Wiener).</p>

Joseph Mallord William Turner.</figcaption></figure>
<h4>Historians and the Industrial Revolution</h4>
<p>How historians view the Industrial Revolution shows how history telling is affected by modern economic, political and social atmospheres. Four phases of interpretation show that the Industrial Revolution was viewed as a negative consequence of human behavior; a cyclical process of nature tied to war and economic challenges; a process for economic growth; and most recently as nothing more than anticipated economic and technological evolution.</p>
<h4><strong>Why does E.P. Thompson hate the standard of living debate?</strong></h4>
<p>Thompson looks at the standard of living between 1790-1840. The biggest issue is that historians sympathetic to capitalist entrepreneurship used the data to match their conclusions, rather than to discover what was there. (Like looking for red cars and noticing how many there are, to the exclusion of noticing all the other colors.) This issue leads to three other issues with historical the look at the standard of living.</p>
<p>1. Historians did not take into consideration that quantity can increase and quality can decrease at the same time. Economic historians take the rise in wages and goods and deduce that quality of live increases too. Social historians look at the writings about poor quality of life and deduce that material wealth declined as well. Thompson argues that the Industrial Revolution brought increase in material goods (wages, products, etc) but the &#8220;well-being&#8221; of workers decreased (decreased leisure time, less independence, longer working hours, etc) (211).</p>
<p>2. Taking an average dilutes the actual findings. Adding the stats for all counties and then dividing by the number of counties to find an &#8220;average&#8221; ignores the discrepancies within the counties. One county may be very rich, another very poor, but combining their info and dividing by their numbers does not provide an accurate description of how those counties actually were (213-214).</p>
<p>3. Quality is subject to interpretation and dependent upon the group you&#8217;re looking at (gentlemen, poor, workers, laborers, etc)</p>
