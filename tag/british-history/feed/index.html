<p>Imperialism in Britain prior to 1857 was to provide wealth to England. After Indian Mutiny in 1857, crown took over East India Company to help England, India, and Co survive. Afterward, they realized their dependence on their colonies and attitudes turned from one of master to one of public servant (there to enlighten India in economics, politics, and education). The realization of their dependence on colonies and their new focus on their relationship with colonies was termed &#8220;new Imperialism&#8221;. Porter and Hobsbawm both put economics as the moving force behind imperialism.</p>
<p>Another impetus for imperialism was the shift in local and national economics to the growing global market economy spawned by industrialist and capitalist needs for goods and resources. Imperialism became a necessity to remain competitive in the global market. If you didn&#8217;t have colonies to supply resources and goods, you didn&#8217;t have global power.</p>
<p>At a time of the rise in sciences of religion, New Imperialism was seen as social Darwinism as the more advanced, developed, and intelligent races naturally ruled over the lower species.</p>
<p>The Boer Wars in South Africa in 1850s and 1890s were significant shocks to Britain as they realized they were not the only players in the global bid for colonies, and, as they discovered in the second war, their nation was virtually unfit to compete in the skirmishes necessary to retain power.</p>

<p>Imperialism creates what Edward Said terms orientalism, or dividing humanity based on culture, and comes about as one country comes to terms with differences encountered in other countries. The universal issues of &#8220;us&#8221; versus &#8220;them&#8221;. Such encounters, especially after their defeat in the 1890 Second Boer War, and the discovery of unfit men, left England seriously questioning the beliefs and culture that led them to that point.</p>
<p>Gender also came to prominent status as mass media and upper classes turned to look at the lower classes and themselves. According to the way some authors (Koven and Walkowitz) portray Victorian society, every aspect of life was actually about sex. Walkowitz looks at how changes in the city brought changes in society and gender spheres. Victorian society became more accepting of sexual discourse through various mass media (mostly newspapers) as more people became literate.</p>
<figure id="attachment_724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-724" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-724" alt="Too much for him!" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism-300x207.jpg" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism-300x207.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism-250x172.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism-150x103.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Brit-Imperialism.jpg 546w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-724" class="wp-caption-text">Too much for him!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Such publicity lead to more exposure to woman&#8217;s rights and needs, as well as abuses (Jack the Ripper) and disreputable employments (prostitution). Some legal changes, including the Married Woman&#8217;s Property Act 1882, gave women more legal power to deal with injustices of the times. Koven looks at the philanthropic movement of &#8220;slumming,&#8221; the practice of upper class individuals visiting the poorest areas of cities in order to observe and often to help. Koven seems obsessed with the sexual aspects of everything, and seems to turn every instance into an opportunity to talk about it. Much too much focused on just one aspect to deliver a clear picture of Victorian period philanthropy. Anyhow, the Victorian period, especially fin de-siecle, was one of dramatic increase in the political address of woman&#8217;s rights.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<h3>How did the Industrial Revolution affect British society and politics?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-500" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-500" title="Steam Engine" alt="" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-300x228.jpg" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-300x228.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-250x190.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-150x114.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-624x475.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1.jpg 656w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-500" class="wp-caption-text">Steam Engine.

<h4>Changes in Lower Classes</h4>
<p>As E.P. Thompson&#8217;s book title suggests, the Industrial Revolution created a new socially aware and politically active group, or class of people. And it created more than one. E.P. focuses on the worker class that was established as people became workers in factories. The Industrial Revolution also created a new middle class of merchants and businessmen.</p>
<p>Industrial Revolution also changed trades. The weavers were the hardest hit. Once a respectable and well paid trade, after industry replaced people with machines, weaver trade was poorly paid and dishonorable. Positions opened up for women and children to work in factories. People moved to more urban areas. F.M.L. Thompson argues though, that these modes of urbanization were already in place and were not affected by industrialization.</p>
<p>This bespeaks a fear seen in all levels of society: the fear of change, the fear of technology, the dominance of machine over man.</p>
<h4>Organizations Lead to Political Activism</h4>
<p>This working class eventually formed unions to deal with issues in the factories, and such organization and collaboration in factory politics spilled out into the politics of government as they eventually sought redresses with Parliament. Dorothy Thompson writes about such a movement known as Chartism, that happened in the 1830s and 1840s. Chartism was a movement of varying and differing causes, with the intent of a better society, fueled by the long unhappy workingmen throughout the country.</p>
<h4>Middle Class Changes in Society</h4>
<p>The middle classes created their own sphere in English society. Wanting to emulate the aristocracy, they embraced the idea of the gentleman and created a culture of private and public spheres for women and men, codes of conduct and beliefs. Industry began a continual decent in the late nineteenth century as the middle class (the owners of industrial factories, the merchants and businessmen) abandon capitalist notions and seek the leisurely life of the gentleman. One argument is that the decline in British industrialism was a direct result of the middle class emulating the aristocracy instead of overcoming them (socially and politically) (Wiener).</p>

Joseph Mallord William Turner.</figcaption></figure>
<h4>Historians and the Industrial Revolution</h4>
<p>How historians view the Industrial Revolution shows how history telling is affected by modern economic, political and social atmospheres. Four phases of interpretation show that the Industrial Revolution was viewed as a negative consequence of human behavior; a cyclical process of nature tied to war and economic challenges; a process for economic growth; and most recently as nothing more than anticipated economic and technological evolution.</p>
<h4><strong>Why does E.P. Thompson hate the standard of living debate?</strong></h4>
<p>Thompson looks at the standard of living between 1790-1840. The biggest issue is that historians sympathetic to capitalist entrepreneurship used the data to match their conclusions, rather than to discover what was there. (Like looking for red cars and noticing how many there are, to the exclusion of noticing all the other colors.) This issue leads to three other issues with historical the look at the standard of living.</p>
<p>1. Historians did not take into consideration that quantity can increase and quality can decrease at the same time. Economic historians take the rise in wages and goods and deduce that quality of live increases too. Social historians look at the writings about poor quality of life and deduce that material wealth declined as well. Thompson argues that the Industrial Revolution brought increase in material goods (wages, products, etc) but the &#8220;well-being&#8221; of workers decreased (decreased leisure time, less independence, longer working hours, etc) (211).</p>
<p>2. Taking an average dilutes the actual findings. Adding the stats for all counties and then dividing by the number of counties to find an &#8220;average&#8221; ignores the discrepancies within the counties. One county may be very rich, another very poor, but combining their info and dividing by their numbers does not provide an accurate description of how those counties actually were (213-214).</p>
<p>3. Quality is subject to interpretation and dependent upon the group you&#8217;re looking at (gentlemen, poor, workers, laborers, etc)</p>
