<h3>Like a block of stone</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 3. 2007: THE STONE IS WAITING by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/502043040/"><img decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/222/502043040_2be8463d8a_m.jpg" alt="MAY 3. 2007: THE STONE IS WAITING" width="240" height="194" /></a></p>
<p>I recently finished writing and rewriting and writing again the essays for several scholarship applications. It is probably a good thing, but that was the most time and effort I have ever spent writing three pages of text. I went through several revisions of each essay, had the wonderful Fulbright advisers at George Mason read and reread the essays, and even went to the vastly underused (by me anyways) campus writing center.</p>
<h3>Roughing it out</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 16. 2007 : DAY 14 by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/507181344/"><img decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/193/507181344_572d027046_m.jpg" alt="MAY 16. 2007 : DAY 14" width="240" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>My personal essay started out as being a little too personal, as in informal. At the writing center, I also realized that the opening paragraph was too negative. I wanted to show how as a child I deeply disliked school. In first and second grades, in order to avoid going to school I would often hide in the backyard or somewhere in the house, and generally make a big stink every morning. One time my mom drove me to school (two blocks away) and when we got there I jumped out of the car and ran off into the neighborhood for an hour or so. The rest of elementary school through high school was better; I did not put up as much of a stink, but I still did not like school. I was convinced that I would never have anything to do with school again once I graduated from high school. That&#8217;s how my essay started out, a general idea of what I wanted to write about. Like a big block of stone that I hacked away at.</p>
<h3>Adding Detail</h3>
<p><a title="MAY 22. 2007: DAY 20 by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/513546327/"><img decoding="async" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/204/513546327_53d439b732_m.jpg" alt="MAY 22. 2007: DAY 20" width="177" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to convey all of that in a couple of sentences, all to point to the irony that I am now pursuing the highest degree one can attain in school, and that I am still in school 16 years later, with another three years to go (I did have three years off in there, though). But the gal at the writing center was right. It was a bit too negative. Instead I focused on my strengths as an historian and my technical skills. This worked out much better, since this is one of the major focuses of the dissertation. Through this constant revision and insight from others my project started to take shape.</p>
<h3>Finishing<br />
<a title="FINISHED AND ON ITS PLACE by Akbar Simonse, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simeon_barkas/1754287634/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2130/1754287634_b87cc656b6_m.jpg" alt="FINISHED AND ON ITS PLACE" width="179" height="240" /></a></h3>
<p>One of the other really neat things about spending so much effort on an essay (especially one about my dissertation research) is that I was really able to focus my arguments and tighten up my thoughts on what I hope to accomplish.Â Through this process of constant revision I realized three things that I wanted to focus on in my dissertation: the story of the underground dispersal projects; how the projects are memorialized or not, and what that says about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VergangenheitsbewÃ¤ltigung">VergangenheitsbewÃ¤ltigung</a>; and an argument for the change in what is considered scholarship in the historical profession. Going through the constant revisions has changed my focus in some small ways from my original proposal in the dissertation prospectus, but that is to be expected. I feel that I now have a much more polished and obtainable goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will invariably get a few questions about how I would teach modern European history as a professor. To prepare for these types of questions I wrote down (actually, I typed them all in, no pencil or paper used <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) the three nations I&#8217;m looking at and some themes, events, and books I would like to use in a course. I struggled with which people, if any to focus on.</p>
<p>A theoretical question I could be asked is: Say you have to teach a course on (Modern England, Modern France, Modern Germany, Modern Europe, World Wars in Europe, etc). What themes, events, people would you focus on and what books would you include? What would be the layout of the course?</p>
<p>I focus on individual countries below, and for a general European course, I would just draw from each of the countries. The books I pull from are only the ones on my Orals reading list. I would most likely supplement with other books after doing some research if I were really teaching a course.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that I probably would never just go chronologically through a time period to hit big events and &#8220;important&#8221; people. History is very subjective. We look back on events and information with a certain set of &#8220;filters&#8221; on. For example we view Germany with political filters, focusing on governments and politicians. Or we may focus on France with cultural filters, looking at food, society, entertainment and arts. It&#8217;s impossible to get a <em>full</em> picture or sense of the past. Just as it&#8217;s impossible to gain a full sense of the present. There&#8217;s just too many people, too many viewpoints, too many sides to the same story, and too many filters to encompass everything. What&#8217;s the point, then? The point is to do what we can. Find what interests you and study the past through that filter. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with learning about one slice of the pie, as long as we don&#8217;t think our slice represents the whole thing. With that said, then, I would probably pick a few themes and have the books, discussions and (unless totally unavoidable) lectures focus on those themes. See the very bottom of this post for a couple of teaching ideas.</p>

<p>Napoleon, Dreyfus, de Gaulle, Petain,</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>
<p>Ford and Weber: compare different ways of looking at nationalism in  France. Bottom-up and Top-down show many ways and nationalism was  sculptured.</p>
<p>Hazareesingh: Argues that concepts of citizenship and a weaker state  government were first established during Second Empire, rather than in  Third Republic. Sources based on elite writings, so it shows what they  wanted, not necessarily what happened, since there was much restriction  of local governments and individual rights.</p>
<p>Nord: Unique way of looking at how Third Republic lasted so long, not  how it could end in Vichy. Shows how Third Republic implemented  political ideas that Hazareesingh shows the Second Empire wanted to use  (decentralized govt., create sense of citizenship, etc). Shows building  of &#8220;traditional&#8221; Victorian ideals about gender, public/private spheres,  middle-class bourgeois life shaped by and influenced politics in France.</p>
<p>McManners: to show the decline in religion, the issues of church and state (infalibility of pope)</p>
<p>Forth (or other book on Dreyfus Affair): Discuss why Dreyfus Affair  was so influential in France and elsewhere. The issues of antisemitism  in places other than Germany, and the masculinity complex in France and  Europe.</p>
<p>Prochaska: To show importance of colonies, especially Algeria, to  France. Stresses that Algeria was France, so issues there were similar  to issues in France. Perhaps also read with Horne about the Algerian  wars and end of France occupation to show the story from occupied and  occupiers.</p>
<p>Weber: Show the interwar years as decisive in France allowing Nazis so much influence in France.</p>
<p>Paxton and Rousso: Show the involvement of Vichy with Nazis, and the national conundrum that places on French narrative.</p>
<p>Hecht: To address the issue of France dealing with their national  image and turning to technology and technocrats as the source of  narrative building.</p>

Also a good book to address methodology,  how should historians write, there are too many ways to explain and  recount history than just political. OR Koshar for the same reasons, but  he focuses on buildings as monuments which provides a tangible  reference to the discussion rather than the theoretical discussion by  Jarausch &amp; Geyer.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>Themes and events to focus on for European history:</p>
<p>Nationalism is the biggest one. Look at political change, republics, democracies, socialism, and communism.</p>
<p>Decline in religion and the increased reliance in science. Modernization.</p>
<p>Economies  of scale. Global markets and capitalism vs socialism vs communism. Role  of Industrial Revolution and colonialism, class and gender.</p>
<p>Colonialism/imperialism as economic, political and cultural motivators.</p>
<p>Gender  issues. Defining gender in Victorian period, creation of &#8220;traditional  roles&#8221;, affect of industrial revolution and capitalism on changing role  of occupations. Changes in legal rights for women and men.</p>
<p>Rise in class consciousness, workers unions, political movements. Failure or success of communist ideals.</p>

<h3>Teaching Ideas</h3>
<p><strong>History Filters</strong></p>
<p>Study  of history is always dependent upon the &#8220;filter&#8221; through which you want  to look at it. It would be fun to divide the class into sections, and  each group take a specific &#8220;filter&#8221; (gender, culture, politics, economy,  class, race, etc). Each group either gets their own reading list or  they have to pull the specific themes from a general list. Then each  class period, each group takes a turn discussing history viewed through  their filter. Have the other groups not presenting write one question  before class and one question after for the presenting group to answer  about their &#8220;filter.&#8221; (Questions could be done on a blog.)</p>
<p><strong>Timelines</strong></p>
<p>Have students make a timeline of the time period the class will be    studying. Then in the first lecture share what my points are and argue    them. Have the students keep their timeline throughout the semester.    They will argue their points, especially if they change them, taking    ideas from the texts. Final paper is a well argued timeline.</p>
