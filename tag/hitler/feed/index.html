										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nazi history is always a good way to sell news, and get people to read.</p>
<p>A few Nazi related items came up in the news lately.</p>
<figure id="attachment_212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-212" title="Hitler" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png" alt="" width="202" height="103" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png 202w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1-150x76.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Never before seen photo of Hitler</figcaption></figure>
<p>From the <a title="Telegraph.co.uk" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/5451531/Unseen-Adolf-Hitler-photographs-published.html" target="_blank">Telegraph.co.uk</a> we have some never before seen photographs of Hitler. From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The colour pictures come from the collection of Hugo Jaeger, Hitler&#8217;s personal photographer, who captured him on camera him from 1936 to the final days of his rule in 1945.</p>
<p>They include a glimpse inside Berghof, his mountaintop estate in Bavaria, and his private apartments in Berlin.&#8221;</p>
<p>This will shed some more light on Hitler and life of top Nazis. It goes well with a find from a fellow PhD student at GMU who found similar photos at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum (<a title="USHMM " href="http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ssalbum/" target="_blank">http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ssalbum/</a>). The photos are of Hitler&#8217;s apartment at Berghof, Hitler mingling with the people and at parades, and other rooms and belongings of Hitler&#8217;s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-213" title="German E-boat" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-300x107.png" alt="" width="300" height="107" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-300x107.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-250x89.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-150x53.png 150w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png 412w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-213" class="wp-caption-text">WWII German E-boat</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also <a title="German E-boat" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30977019/" target="_blank">in the news</a> is a recently uncovered German E-Boat, the S130, which interrupted an allied D-Day training and killed over 700 American servicemen. It is being reconstructed and will be used as a memorial of those who fought in World War II. From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;As owner the world&#8217;s largest privately held collection of military vehicles, Wheatcroft said he envisions the restored vessel as being a &#8220;living memorial to all sailors who died during World War Two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only example of its type left in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want it to become like something brought back from the past.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-214" title="Horton 2-29" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png" alt="" width="409" height="195" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png 409w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-300x143.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-250x119.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-214" class="wp-caption-text">Reconstructed Horton 2-29</figcaption></figure>
<p>And, finally, another World War II vessel <a title="Horton 2-29" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090625-hitlers-stealth-fighter-plane.html" target="_blank">making the news is the Horten 2-29</a>. This was a stealth jet developed by a couple of brothers. It has the uncanny resemblance to our B-2 stealth bomber. Here is <a title="Horton 2-29" href="http://resound1.com/nazi-stealth-jet-could-have-won-war-for-hitler/" target="_blank">a site</a> with a number of cool pictures. National Geographic has a cool documentary about a team of engineers at Northrop Grumman who reconstructed the airplane to test it&#8217;s stealth abilities. Most amazing of all, I think, is that the plane was made from wood! That and several layers of paint, aparently, are what make it nearly invisible to radar. I&#8217;ll have to do some research into this machine and write up a history of it.</p>
