<p>1 Corinthians 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>



<p>We can readily see the importance of taking care of our physical/natural body. We must feed it, rest it, wash it, exercise it.</p>



<p>Do we likewise take care of our spiritual body?</p>



<p>How do we feed, rest, wash and exercise our spiritual body?</p>



<p>We must feed it truth, learning, wisdom, and knowledge from books and other media. We must feed it good, uplifting, wholesome interactions with others.</p>



<p>We rest our spiritual body with meditation, prayer, mindfulness, positive self-talk.</p>



<p>We wash our spirit through the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ&#8217;s atonement for our souls. We use his enabling power to overcome habits we don&#8217;t want with habits we do want. We rid our mind of impure thoughts, our bodies of hurtful actions. We clean our spirits by removing from our thoughts anything that is undesirable, that does not help us become what we want to be.</p>



<p>We exercise our spirits through doing things that are hard; hard work, new skills, healthy thinking patterns, etc. When we have to choose mind over matter. When we choose long term benefit and short term loss over short term gain and long term loss. </p>
