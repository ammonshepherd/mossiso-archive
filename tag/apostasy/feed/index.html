<p><a title="Mark 2: 21-22" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/mark/2/21-22#21" target="_blank">Mark 2: 21-22</a> gives an analogy for why the church of God needed to be restored. Jesus has been asked why his disciples do not fast, but those of John and the Pharisees do. Jesus responds with an analogy that those with a bridegroom do not fast, but only when he is not present. He then expounds, in the aforementioned analogy, that the bridegroom, referring to himself, will not be with the people always. But that he, Jesus, will return again. And when he does, it will not be to the same organization that is a remnant of what he left. As he says, new cloth should not be sewn into an old garment because the new cloth is stronger and will make the hole worse. New wine is not stored in old wine bottles (usually made of leather), because the old leather will not stretch as the wine expands during fermentation and will break the bottle.</p>
<p>Jesus shows that there will be an Apostasy or a time of separation from him and the truth when he says in Mark 2: 20, that the bridegroom will be taken away, and in that time they shall have to fast.</p>
<p>When the gospel and Christ&#8217;s church is restored to earth, it will need to be done in a new vessel. The truths restored would break the old church. It would not be able to support the changes needed to be made. They would not be able to support the restored gospel, rules, structure, mentality, organization and way of life required by Christ&#8217;s true church. A completely new structure was needed. Built from the ground up, piece by piece with someone in charge who was completely dependant upon Christ for direction and understanding. Why not take a young, barely educated boy and make him the leader and builder of the restored and eternal organization of Christ&#8217;s gospel?</p>
<p><a title="James 3: 4" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/james/3/4/" target="_blank">James 3: 4</a> teaches that it is a small helm that guides a large ship. It must be a small and simple person to bring about the great restoration.</p>
<p>In <a title="1 Nephi 16: 29" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/16/29/#29" target="_blank">1 Nephi 16: 29</a>, Nephi teaches us with the story of the Liahona, that it is by small means that great things are brought to pass when done with faith and diligence.</p>
<p>Alma warns in <a title="Alma 37: 7" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/37/7/#7" target="_blank">Alma 37: 7</a> and <a title="Alma 37: 41" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/37/41/#41" target="_blank">41</a> that we must not forget that the Lord works by small means to confound the wise, and to use our faith and diligence in remembering this fact.</p>
<p>The Lord provides encouragement in a revelation (<a title="D&amp;C 64: 33" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/64/33/#33" target="_blank">D&amp;C 64: 33</a>) to Joseph Smith on September 11, 1831. He counsels us to not be weary in doing good things, for it is by our small and simple acts that he brings about his great work.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith was the small and simple person, chosen by God to restore his church on the earth. He built the church anew, reestablishing the doctrines, ordinances, covenants and organization that had existed before, but were lost due to the Apostasy.</p>
