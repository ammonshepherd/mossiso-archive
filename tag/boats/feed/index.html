										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nazi history is always a good way to sell news, and get people to read.</p>
<p>A few Nazi related items came up in the news lately.</p>
<figure id="attachment_212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-212" title="Hitler" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png" alt="" width="202" height="103" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png 202w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1-150x76.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Never before seen photo of Hitler</figcaption></figure>
<p>From the <a title="Telegraph.co.uk" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/5451531/Unseen-Adolf-Hitler-photographs-published.html" target="_blank">Telegraph.co.uk</a> we have some never before seen photographs of Hitler. From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The colour pictures come from the collection of Hugo Jaeger, Hitler&#8217;s personal photographer, who captured him on camera him from 1936 to the final days of his rule in 1945.</p>
<p>They include a glimpse inside Berghof, his mountaintop estate in Bavaria, and his private apartments in Berlin.&#8221;</p>
<p>This will shed some more light on Hitler and life of top Nazis. It goes well with a find from a fellow PhD student at GMU who found similar photos at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum (<a title="USHMM " href="http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ssalbum/" target="_blank">http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ssalbum/</a>). The photos are of Hitler&#8217;s apartment at Berghof, Hitler mingling with the people and at parades, and other rooms and belongings of Hitler&#8217;s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-213" title="German E-boat" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-300x107.png" alt="" width="300" height="107" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-300x107.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-250x89.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-150x53.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png 412w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-213" class="wp-caption-text">WWII German E-boat</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also <a title="German E-boat" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30977019/" target="_blank">in the news</a> is a recently uncovered German E-Boat, the S130, which interrupted an allied D-Day training and killed over 700 American servicemen. It is being reconstructed and will be used as a memorial of those who fought in World War II. From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;As owner the world&#8217;s largest privately held collection of military vehicles, Wheatcroft said he envisions the restored vessel as being a &#8220;living memorial to all sailors who died during World War Two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only example of its type left in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want it to become like something brought back from the past.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-214" title="Horton 2-29" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png" alt="" width="409" height="195" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png 409w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-300x143.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-250x119.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-214" class="wp-caption-text">Reconstructed Horton 2-29</figcaption></figure>
<p>And, finally, another World War II vessel <a title="Horton 2-29" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090625-hitlers-stealth-fighter-plane.html" target="_blank">making the news is the Horten 2-29</a>. This was a stealth jet developed by a couple of brothers. It has the uncanny resemblance to our B-2 stealth bomber. Here is <a title="Horton 2-29" href="http://resound1.com/nazi-stealth-jet-could-have-won-war-for-hitler/" target="_blank">a site</a> with a number of cool pictures. National Geographic has a cool documentary about a team of engineers at Northrop Grumman who reconstructed the airplane to test it&#8217;s stealth abilities. Most amazing of all, I think, is that the plane was made from wood! That and several layers of paint, aparently, are what make it nearly invisible to radar. I&#8217;ll have to do some research into this machine and write up a history of it.</p>

<p>I came across the site <a title="Artificial Owl" href="http://www.artificialowl.net/" target="_blank">Artificial Owl</a> this week. Artificial Owl finds images of long forgotten, man-made objects, locates them on a map and tells a bit of the story behind the object if possible. I was initially struck by the beautiful images of buildings, ships, airplanes, and automobiles left to deteriorate and crumble back to nature. I love the imagery of nature reclaiming her elements. It&#8217;s a definite reminder that man and his creations will not last longer than mother earth.</p>
<p>There were a number of images of airplanes, which I was glad to see, since I like them most. One of them was particularly interesting for a couple of reasons. First of all, it&#8217;s a picture of a B-29. I love B-29s and B-17s from World War II. The reason, besides them being beautiful airplanes, is because my grandfather was a belly gunner in a B-17 during WWII. He, and an uncle, had numerous models and paintings of B-17s and other WWII fighter planes in my grandpa&#8217;s basement. I even put together a model of a B-17 myself as a kid. So, naturally, my interest was peaked. Another reason I was interested in this picture is because I remember hearing about it. The very brief history of this airplane goes like this.</p>
<figure id="attachment_186" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-186" title="B29 Kee Bird near Thule, Greenland" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-250x166.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-150x100.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-624x416.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-186" class="wp-caption-text">B29 Kee Bird, on frozen lake near Thule, Greenland</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1947 the Kee Bird (as it was called), was on a top secret spy mission. It made an emergency landing on a frozen lake near Thule, Greenland. The crew were all fine and rescued, but the airplane was left. In the 1990s, a few older gentlemen decided they would rescue the airplane. After lots of money and time (nearly a year), they repaired the engines and minor damage to the plane, and prepared to take off. As they taxied around the bumpy frozen lake, one of the generators used for power broke loose and started a fire in the airplane. All of the crew escaped, but the airplane was destroyed by fire. When the lake melted in the summer, the plane sank to the bottom, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>All of this got me thinking that this would be an awesome way to do history. There is so much information connected to this one airplane, that it could easily fill a <a title="Hunting Warbirds by Carl Hoffman" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345436180?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ao07c-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0345436180" target="_blank">book</a> or <a title="NOVA: B-29 Frozen in Time" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWGYW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ao07c-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000HEWGYW" target="_blank">documentary</a>. I haven&#8217;t read either of them, but either would definitely be an interesting read. It would be fun to research the history of the plane, the details and reasoning behind the flight, the biographies of the crew, and all that jazz. There is so much history that can be incorporated into the story of this airplane.</p>
<p>This could be done for all of the images on Artificial Owl, in fact for any abandoned man-made object. As I reflect on that, this is precisely what I want to do with my dissertation. I want to focus on one abandoned tunnel in Halberstadt, Germany. It was used by the Germans before, during and after WWII. It think telling the story of this tunnel can incorporate many aspects of German history around it. Time will tell on how that works out.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ll leave you with a few more pics of possible historical tales&#8230;</p>
