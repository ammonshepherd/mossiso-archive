										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently did the 130 miles on Skyline Drive. This was the third year in a row to do this ride. It was lots of fun, and lots of pain. I purchased a brand new cyclo-cross bike and got it the day before the ride. That was a bad mistake. Take a bike that you&#8217;ve been on a few times&#8230;</p>
<p>I had a few troubles with the brakes and front derailleur, but all in all it was a great trip. We stayed overnight in Waynesboro.</p>
<p>We went 66.8 miles on Friday, from Hawkes Bill Gap to Waynesboro, and 65.3 back the next day, for a total of 132.1 miles. I averaged about 6 or 7 miles an hour, and as you can see from the elevation profile, that was usually the speed up the hills. I got up to 40 miles/hour on one of the down hills.</p>
<p>Highlights of the trip: much nicer bike to ride than previous years, seeing a bear, turkey, and deer, speaking German to a couple from Germany, being interviewed by a news lady (someone had driven off the side of a cliff on Skyline Drive the day before), surviving 130 miles!</p>
<p>I was definitely worn out by the end of the ride. I&#8217;ll have to be in much better shape next year.</p>
<p>Thanks to Don and Taylor, two good buddies for making the trip possible.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve already been out on a quick 14 mile ride (in only one hour).<br />
