										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, this was my first ever <a href="http://thatcamp.org/">THATCamp</a> experience. Seems hard to imagine since I have worked at CHNM since before the inception of THATCamp.  Ah, well, the stars finally aligned, and was able to attend this year. And it was great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attended three <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/">workshops</a> on Friday, and a <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/11/a-better-blogging-assignment/">couple</a> of <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/15/shell-tutorial/">sessions</a> on Saturday. Here are some thoughts&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/#data-mining">Digital Data Mining with Weka</a>: This was a neat <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~hrangwal/dhdm">crash course</a> on what data mining is and is not, and one free tool to help do some of that. It was more of a &#8220;here&#8217;s what&#8217;s out there, how does it apply to the humanities&#8221; than a hands on, hands dirty, do some real work type of work shop. But it was good in that it opened up the possibility to do some data mining in the future. Since they were relatively small, here my notes:</p>
<p>What is data mining?</p>
<p>examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>recommend ads, products to users based on purchases</li>
<li>finding patterns in large amounts of text (writing algorithms to find those patterns)</li>
</ul>
<p>Goal of data mining is to predict what users/people will do based on data from other users/people</p>
<p>Data mining Tasks: classification, clustering, association rule discovery, sequential pattern discovery, regression, deviation detection</p>
<p>Goal is to predict the classification (or whatever) of future data, based on the current data that you analyze.</p>
<p>Cross validation (when done correctly you get true results, when not done correctly you get false results)</p>
<p>have multiple sets of data, one for training and the other for testing. Build the algorithm on the training data, then run it on the test. Then cycle through each testing data set and have it act as a training set. Do this way because you know the results for each, so you can tell if your algorithm is correct. When it&#8217;s good then you can use it on future data where you don&#8217;t know the result.</p>
<p><a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/#git">Interesting Things You Can Do With Gi</a>t: This one was highly anticipated. I have been wanting/needing to learn git for a while now. For being in the IT field, having written some code, and even having a GitHub account with code on it, I&#8217;m ashamed to say I still don&#8217;t know how to use git effectively. There is not much you can do in 1.5 hours, and this was more a theoretical &#8220;here are some ideas&#8221;, than a &#8220;here is how to do it&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>The session on using <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/11/a-better-blogging-assignment/">blogs as assignments</a> was maybe a bit premature for me. The session was really good, great ideas, tips, etc. But me teaching is still too far away for me to have put the mental effort in to following along much. I spent most of the time trying to find a good twitter client, but in the end just stuck with <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>.</p>
<p>Then I took some time to enjoy the hacker space. I decided it was time, and this was the perfect place to set up a transcription tool for my dissertation archive. So sitting at the very table where it is coded, I installed the <a href="http://scripto.org/">Scripto</a> plugin for Omeka. That&#8217;s a bit of a misnomer, since it is really a wrapper that lets Omeka and a Wikimedia install play nicely together. I went ahead and transcribed one of the documents in the archive as well. The archive is just in the testing phase, but here it is anyways: <a href="http://nazitunnels.org/archive">http://nazitunnels.org/archive</a></p>
<figure id="attachment_1261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1261" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://nazitunnels.org/archive/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1261  " title="Screen Shot 2012-06-18 at 4.50.06 PM" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM.png" alt="" width="780" height="658" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM.png 975w, wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-300x252.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-250x210.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-150x126.png 150w, wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-624x526.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1261" class="wp-caption-text">Nazi Tunnels Archive</figcaption></figure>
<p>The final event of THATCamp for me was one last session proposed by a fellow &#8220;camper&#8221;. She wanted help <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/15/shell-tutorial/">learning about the shell</a>/terminal/command line. So I volunteered to help out with that. It ended up that there were about eight people that wanted help learning the command line, and four of us that knew what we were doing. So it ended up being a great ratio of help needed to those who could offer it. We started with the very basics, didn&#8217;t get much past a few commands (ls, cd, rm, nano, grep, cat), but we went slow enough that everybody who was trying to follow along was able to, and they all left with a clearer understanding of what the shell is for, and why it is useful. The proposer found a <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">great tutorial/book for learning the command line</a> that I&#8217;ll have to go through as well. You can always learn something new.</p>
<p>What was also great about that session, since it was basically ran by those who needed the help, I saw how those who struggle with these concepts learn them, so I will hopefully be better able to teach them to others in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I forgot to mention the many cool sites and projects mentioned during Saturday morning&#8217;s Dork Shorts. Here&#8217;s a list of the ones I took notice of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What space junky, almost historian, geek would I be without posting a little bit about some of the best type of history in existence. I refer, of course, to the history of man&#8217;s endeavors to explore space. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to step on a celestial body other than Earth. Michael Collins waited in the Command capsule as the two American astronauts made human history.</p>
<p>So here are a number of resources and articles describing some cool things about space flight.</p>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-21.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-281" title="Apollo missions poster" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-21.png" alt="Apollo missions poster" width="150" height="100" /></a><a href="http://historicspacecraft.com/index.html">Historic Spacecraft</a> is an archive of space vehicles and other things space related. They have a lot of photos of vehicles, suits, and such. They also have posters and such for sell, if you&#8217;re inclined to have something on your wall. They also have stats and dates for all of the rockets and vehicles listed. A great source for photos for all your space history needs. Also really cool is a list of all completed <a href="http://historicspacecraft.com/Space_Shuttle.html#LIST">Space Shuttle</a> missions. Space Shuttle Discovery has flown the most missions, 36, so far (June 2009) with a total of 126 missions. The Space Shuttle Enterprise never made it to space, but you can see it at the <a href="http://www.nasm.si.edu/UdvarHazy/">Udvar-Hazy National Air and Space Museum</a> in Dulles, VA. I&#8217;ve been there a couple of times, and it is extremely awesome.</p>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-6.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-285" title="Apollo 11 interactive guide" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-6.png" alt="Apollo 11 interactive guide" width="150" height="60" /></a>Next up from <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/page/Apollo-40th-Anniversary/">Flightglobal</a> is an interactive timeline of sorts, with lots of information about the missions, flights, computers, physics and people who made it possible to put man on the moon. Most amazing about the whole flight, is that everything was based on theory. There was no way to test the actual theoretical physics without flying to the moon and back. &#8220;Although the theoretical physics of travelling to the Moon had been laid down before the advent of the Apollo missions, this was the first time a series of manned missions had put the theory into practice.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-41.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-283" title="apollo 11 software" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-41.png" alt="apollo 11 software" width="150" height="61" /></a>Speaking of computers, <a href="http://linux.com/news/software/developer/29068-apollo-11-story">Linux.com</a> has a neat write up about the software used to guide the Apollo 11 spacecraft to the moon and back. It&#8217;s incredible to think that they were able to do such an amazing thing with technology comparable to today&#8217;s calculators. All of the code used punch cards and took hours to see if it was written properly. Jerry Bostick described the process in the Linux.com article:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We would give instructions to the programs by punching cards,&#8221; Bostick said. &#8220;You had to wait at least 12 hours to see if it would work right.&#8221; The early programming was done in the real-time computing complex in Houston using IBM 7094 computers with 64K of memory. There were no hard disks. All the data was stored on magnetic tape, with each computer having about eight tape drives. Most programs used for the mission were written in Fortran, Bostick said. &#8220;After Apollo 1, we upgraded to the biggest and the best equipment that government money could buy, the IBM 360 with an unheard of 1MB of memory. We went all the way from 64K to 1MB.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-5.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-284" title="lunar lander games" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-5.png" alt="lunar lander games" width="150" height="63" /></a>Moving from space computers to space computer games, the <a href="http://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/">Technologizer</a> has a great piece about a well loved space game, Lunar Lander. This game started out as a text-based game written by a high school student. It became popular and was later turned into countless graphical spin offs. I&#8217;m playing one on the iPod Touch a bit too much at the moment. You can see I made the top 20 players for a while!</p>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-10.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289" title="19th place" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-10.png" alt="19th place" width="300" height="403" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-10.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-10-223x300.png 223w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-10-250x335.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-10-111x150.png 111w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<div style="height: 410px;"></div>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-7.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-286" title="museum moon" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-7.png" alt="museum moon" width="150" height="91" /></a>Finally, New Scientist has a number of interesting articles relating to the 40th anniversary of the moon landing. <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327162.500-apollo-special-the-loneliest-museum.html?full=true">One article</a> addresses with the ethics and issues with the moon being a historic spot. Wherever there is a piece of human debris or footstep, it&#8217;s historically valuable. Should all of these sites and artifacts and footprints be protected? What happens when/if tourists are able to visit the moon? Who&#8217;s going to be the museum curator and the tourist guides? I&#8217;ll take that job!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/special/apollo-11">Another New Scientist</a> article lists several reasons why the moon is still relevant to science, for government, commercial enterprise and the normal guy.</p>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-9.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-288" title="interactive moon map" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-9.png" alt="interactive moon map" width="150" height="90" /></a>Lastly, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/embedded/apollo-11-interactive-lunar-map">New Scientist has a neat interactive map</a> showing the many multi-national places on the moon where humans have left their mark and made exploration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What I have for you this week are just a few websites that give us access to the past, an historical artifact that uncovers a mystery, and some new ways to do timelines.</p>
<figure id="attachment_188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a title="wdl" href="http://www.wdl.org/en/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-188" title="world digital library" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-1-150x69.png" alt="World Digital Library" width="150" height="69" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-188" class="wp-caption-text">World Digital Library</figcaption></figure>
<p>A great resource, hopefully, for scholars. From their website&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The World Digital Library (WDL) makes available on the Internet, free of charge and in multilingual format, significant primary materials from countries and cultures around the world.</p>
<p>The principal objectives of the WDL are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote international and intercultural understanding;</li>
<li>Expand the volume and variety of cultural content on the Internet;</li>
<li>Provide resources for educators, scholars, and general audiences;</li>
<li>Build capacity in partner institutions to narrow the digital divide within and between countries.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a title="cdli" href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-190" title="cdli" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-2-150x53.png" alt="cuneform digital library initiative" width="150" height="53" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-190" class="wp-caption-text">cuneform digital library initiative</figcaption></figure>
<p>Related to the WDL, is the CDLI. From their website&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative</strong> (CDLI) represents the efforts of an international group of Assyriologists, museum curators and historians of science to make available through the internet the form and content of cuneiform tablets dating from the beginning of writing, ca. 3350 BC, until the end of the pre-Christian era. We estimate the number of these documents currently kept in public and private collections to exceed 500,000 exemplars, of which now nearly 225,000 have been catalogued in electronic form by the CDLI.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-191" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a title="harrison's sea clock" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17119-lone-longitude-genius-may-have-had-help.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-191" title="sea clock" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dn17119-1_300.jpg" alt="John Harrison sea clock" width="150" height="112" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-191" class="wp-caption-text">John Harrison sea clock</figcaption></figure>
<p>And here&#8217;s a short read on an interesting historical topic. It seems the history of the longitude will need a small rewrite. What&#8217;s most amazing, though, is the skill and craftsmanship of the compass at the heart of this historical debate.  Created over 270 years ago, the original parts show no sign of wear and tear, while replacement parts broke down after 80 years. A remarkable piece of history.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding this clock comes from recent work to replace broken parts from the initial attempt at restoration. It was originally believed that John Harrison created this clock all by himself. He being originally a carpenter, some scholars are a bit skeptic that he could create the intricate brass work needed to create the piece.  The most recent repairs have lead people to believe Harrison had help, and probably commissioned out certain pieces. Comprising over 2000 pieces, this sea clock is a marvel of itself, regardless of who made it.</p>
<p><strong>Now it&#8217;s time for some timelines!</strong></p>
<p>It was a <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/05/20/2337230" target="_blank">shameless publicity post to slashdot</a>, but the timelines got me thinking of other timelines, especially as I&#8217;m creating one of <a href="http://ammica.us/ammon/apostles" target="_blank">my own</a> using <a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/" target="_blank">MIT&#8217;s Exhibit builder</a>, and have created <a href="http://gmu.mossiso.com/689/" target="_blank">one for a course</a>. So, here are a few timeline tools mentioned in the article.</p>
<div style="margin:60px;"><a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-195" title="simile-timeline" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/simile-timeline.png" alt="simile-timeline" width="228" height="52" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2009/05/simile-timeline.png 380w, wp-content/uploads/2009/05/simile-timeline-300x68.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2009/05/simile-timeline-250x57.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/05/simile-timeline-150x34.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /></a> SIMILE&#8217;s Timeline: easy to use, just point it to a data file (which is the most dificult part)</div>
<div style="margin:60px;"><a href="http://timeglider.com/" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-196" title="timeglider" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/timeglider.png" alt="timeglider" width="241" height="36" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/timeglider.png 668w, wp-content/uploads/2009/05/timeglider-300x44.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2009/05/timeglider-250x37.png 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/05/timeglider-150x22.png 150w, wp-content/uploads/2009/05/timeglider-624x93.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /></a> TimeGlider: Looks like a flashed based version of SIMILE&#8217;s product. A few different features. Here&#8217;s one in action, <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/cwihp/rosenberg/" target="_blank">Rosenberg Cold War trials</a>.</div>

<p>I came across the site <a title="Artificial Owl" href="http://www.artificialowl.net/" target="_blank">Artificial Owl</a> this week. Artificial Owl finds images of long forgotten, man-made objects, locates them on a map and tells a bit of the story behind the object if possible. I was initially struck by the beautiful images of buildings, ships, airplanes, and automobiles left to deteriorate and crumble back to nature. I love the imagery of nature reclaiming her elements. It&#8217;s a definite reminder that man and his creations will not last longer than mother earth.</p>
<p>There were a number of images of airplanes, which I was glad to see, since I like them most. One of them was particularly interesting for a couple of reasons. First of all, it&#8217;s a picture of a B-29. I love B-29s and B-17s from World War II. The reason, besides them being beautiful airplanes, is because my grandfather was a belly gunner in a B-17 during WWII. He, and an uncle, had numerous models and paintings of B-17s and other WWII fighter planes in my grandpa&#8217;s basement. I even put together a model of a B-17 myself as a kid. So, naturally, my interest was peaked. Another reason I was interested in this picture is because I remember hearing about it. The very brief history of this airplane goes like this.</p>
<figure id="attachment_186" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-186" title="B29 Kee Bird near Thule, Greenland" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-250x166.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-150x100.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775-624x416.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2009/04/6566775.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-186" class="wp-caption-text">B29 Kee Bird, on frozen lake near Thule, Greenland</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1947 the Kee Bird (as it was called), was on a top secret spy mission. It made an emergency landing on a frozen lake near Thule, Greenland. The crew were all fine and rescued, but the airplane was left. In the 1990s, a few older gentlemen decided they would rescue the airplane. After lots of money and time (nearly a year), they repaired the engines and minor damage to the plane, and prepared to take off. As they taxied around the bumpy frozen lake, one of the generators used for power broke loose and started a fire in the airplane. All of the crew escaped, but the airplane was destroyed by fire. When the lake melted in the summer, the plane sank to the bottom, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>All of this got me thinking that this would be an awesome way to do history. There is so much information connected to this one airplane, that it could easily fill a <a title="Hunting Warbirds by Carl Hoffman" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345436180?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ao07c-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0345436180" target="_blank">book</a> or <a title="NOVA: B-29 Frozen in Time" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWGYW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ao07c-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000HEWGYW" target="_blank">documentary</a>. I haven&#8217;t read either of them, but either would definitely be an interesting read. It would be fun to research the history of the plane, the details and reasoning behind the flight, the biographies of the crew, and all that jazz. There is so much history that can be incorporated into the story of this airplane.</p>
<p>This could be done for all of the images on Artificial Owl, in fact for any abandoned man-made object. As I reflect on that, this is precisely what I want to do with my dissertation. I want to focus on one abandoned tunnel in Halberstadt, Germany. It was used by the Germans before, during and after WWII. It think telling the story of this tunnel can incorporate many aspects of German history around it. Time will tell on how that works out.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ll leave you with a few more pics of possible historical tales&#8230;</p>
