<p>1 Corinthians 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>



<p>We can readily see the importance of taking care of our physical/natural body. We must feed it, rest it, wash it, exercise it.</p>



<p>Do we likewise take care of our spiritual body?</p>



<p>How do we feed, rest, wash and exercise our spiritual body?</p>



<p>We must feed it truth, learning, wisdom, and knowledge from books and other media. We must feed it good, uplifting, wholesome interactions with others.</p>



<p>We rest our spiritual body with meditation, prayer, mindfulness, positive self-talk.</p>



<p>We wash our spirit through the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ&#8217;s atonement for our souls. We use his enabling power to overcome habits we don&#8217;t want with habits we do want. We rid our mind of impure thoughts, our bodies of hurtful actions. We clean our spirits by removing from our thoughts anything that is undesirable, that does not help us become what we want to be.</p>



<p>We exercise our spirits through doing things that are hard; hard work, new skills, healthy thinking patterns, etc. When we have to choose mind over matter. When we choose long term benefit and short term loss over short term gain and long term loss. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read 2 Nephi chapter 31 recently, and was struck by the simple and pure and direct way it explains the doctrine of Christ. The testimony of the doctrine of Christ in 2 Nephi 31 is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus lived and does live</li>
<li>Jesus was a perfect example. He was even baptized to show the importance of baptism and the importance of being obedient. We might feel that some commandments and rules do not apply to us, but Jesus showed the example that we should obey all the commandments of God.</li>
<li>Follow God&#8217;s commandments.</li>
<li>Repent</li>
<li>Be baptized in the name of Jesus</li>
<li>Receive the Holy Ghost</li>
<li>Endure to the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>The message is so pure and simple that it can be found in just two verses, 17 and 20. Again, the Doctrine of Christ is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Repentence</li>
<li>Baptism</li>
<li>Holy Ghost</li>
<li>Press Forward &#8211; keep the commandments</li>
<li>Feast on the words of Christ</li>
<li>Endure to the end</li>
</ol>
<p>What a blessing to have the Gospel, the Doctrine of Christ laid out so plainly and clearly. I&#8217;m not sure if it is so concise and clear in the other scriptures. Some day I&#8217;ll have to look through and see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>John chapters 20-21</strong></p>
<p>In this lesson, I hoped the students would:</p>
<ul>
<li>gain (or strengthen) a testimony of the resurrected Jesus</li>
<li>commit to follow Jesus by &#8220;feeding&#8221; his &#8220;sheep&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Three Levels of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-641"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/gateway.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-131" title="Jesus_Mary_resurrection" src="http://ammica.us/ammon/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/gateway-150x150.jpg" alt="Jesus_Mary_resurrection" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/gateway-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-130" title="Jesus_resurrected" src="http://ammica.us/ammon/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/gateway-1-150x150.jpg" alt="Jesus_resurrected" width="150" height="150" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p>John gives examples that show three levels of knowledge about our resurrected Lord, Jesus Christ. These examples show what evidence was given to certain people in order that they might believe and know that Jesus was resurrected.</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="John 20: 1-10" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/20/1-10/#1" target="_blank">John 20: 1-10</a> &#8211; Certain apostles are confronted with an empty tomb. This is enough for them to realize and believe that Jesus is resurrected.</li>
<li><a title="John 20: 11-18" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/20/11-18/#11" target="_blank">John 20: 11-18</a> &#8211; Jesus shows himself to Mary. She believes and knows Jesus is resurrected.</li>
<li><a title="John 20: 19-29" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/20/19-29/#19" target="_blank">John 20: 19-29</a> &#8211; Jesus shows himself to the apostles and to Thomas. They touch him and feel that he is resurrected.</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples show three different levels of knowledge and faith about the resurrection of Jesus. The first level need only a small sign, and quick prick of rememberance to believe. The second level need to see to believe. The third level need to feel and see.</p>
<p><a title="John 20: 29" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/20/29/#29" target="_blank">John 20: 29</a> &#8211; Why is it better to believe without seeing or feeling? How will we approach trials and hard choices when we have a believing-while-not-seeing attidute?</p>
<p><strong>Enthusiasm to Follow</strong></p>
<p><a title="John 21: 1-7" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/21/1-7/#1" target="_blank">John 21: 1-7</a> &#8211; Peter shows his great enthusiasm to follow the Savior by jumping from the boat and swimming ashore in order to reach Jesus more quickly. We should also cultivate such a desire to serve Jesus.</p>
<p><a title="John 21: 3, 6" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/21/3,6/#3" target="_blank">John 21: 3, 6</a> teach us that when we listen to and follow Jesus&#8217; counsel we will be significantly more blessed than when we rely on our own strength.</p>

<p>Why ask three times? Jesus refers to his children, his youth, and his adults.</p>
<p>What are some ways that we can feed his sheep?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another Seminary lesson.</p>
<p>John chaptes 14-17.</p>
<p><strong>Two Comforters</strong></p>
<p>Jesus speaks of two comforters. Who are they? John 14: 15-27 shows that they are the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ himself. Jesus gives the following promises in these verses.</p>
<ol>
<li>v. 16 &#8211; Christ prays for us that he will be with us</li>
<li>v. 17 &#8211; Christ shall dwell with and in us</li>
<li>v. 18 &#8211; Christ will not leave us comfortless (This from the man who was left completely and entirely alone for a time as he completed the Atonement.)</li>
<li>v. 19 &#8211; Christ sees us and we live because of His Atonement.</li>
<li>v. 20 &#8211; We shall know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ</li>
<li>v. 21 &#8211; We shall be loved of the Father and Jesus will show himself to us</li>
<li>v. 26 &#8211; The Holy Ghost will teach all things and bring all things to remembrance</li>
<li>v. 27 &#8211; We can have peace through Jesus Christ.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-637"></span></p>
<p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These statements about the two Comforters climax and crown the teachings of the Son of God. We have no record of anything he ever said which can so completely withdraw the curtain of eternity and open to the faithful a vision of the glories of God. Based on love, born of obedience, Jesus promises the saints that they can have, here and now in this life, the following:</p>
<p>(1) The gift and constant companionship of the Holy Ghost; the comfort and peace which it is the function of that Holy Spirit to bestow; the revelation and the sanctifying power which alone will prepare men for the companionship of gods and angels hereafter;</p>
<p>(2) Personal visitations from the Second Comforter, the Lord Jesus Christ himself, the resurrected and perfected being who dwells with his Father in the mansions on high; and</p>
<p>(3) God the Father&#8230; shall visit man in person, take up his abode with him, as it were, and reveal to  him all the hidden mysteries of his kingdom&#8221; (<em>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary</em>, 1:735).</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jesus should be the source of our power.</strong></p>

</p>
<p>How are we like the tool and the plant? The tool must be plugged in to work, the plant must have roots to grow. We must be &#8220;plugged in&#8221; to Jesus Christ in order to do the work we were made to do. We receive our nurishment through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>John 15: 1-8. What do the following symbols represent?</p>
<ul>
<li>grapevine (v. 1)</li>
<li>husbandmen (v. 1)</li>
<li>branches (v. 2)</li>
<li>fruit (v. 2)</li>
<li>withered branches (v. 6)</li>
</ul>
<p>What can we learn?</p>
<p><strong>Jesus as Intercessor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is an advocate?</li>
<li>In a court, what role do the following people play: defendant, prosecutor, defense attorney, judge, jury</li>
<li>In life, who are those characters?</li>
</ul>
<p>John 17. Jesus pleads to be our defense attorney.</p>
<ul>
<li>v. 11 &#8211; He asks to keep us in Heavenly Father&#8217;s name, be one with Jesus as he is with the Father</li>
<li>v. 13 &#8211; He desires a fulfillment of our joy</li>
<li>v. 15 &#8211; He seeks to keep us from evil</li>
<li>v. 17 &#8211; He wishes to sanctify us through truth</li>
<li>v. 21 &#8211; He asks that we may be one with him</li>
<li>v. 22 &#8211; He wants us to receive his glory</li>
<li>v. 23 &#8211; He prays that we may be made perfect through him</li>
<li>v. 24 &#8211; He prays that we can be where he is, and with his glory</li>
<li>v. 26 &#8211; He prays that we can receive Heavenly Father&#8217;s name and that his love will be in us.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently was a substitute for our Ward&#8217;s early morning Seminary. I&#8217;m amazed at these kids who get to the Church building at 6am for some scripture study. I had it easy with release time. I took seminary as if it were a regular class in high school. Anyhow, the next few posts will be a few of the lessons we had. I was able to finish the last half of the Gospel of John.</p>
<p><strong>John chapters 12-14</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>importance of love</li>
<li>putting Christ before our own selfish desires</li>
</ul>
<p>(write on the board) &#8220;If you loved me, you would ____________ .&#8221; How might these people fill in the blank&#8230; a mother, a sister, Edward Collins, a father, a bad boyfriend, a good girlfriend</p>
<p><span id="more-633"></span></p>
<p>(read) John 14:15 How would Jesus respond.</p>
<ul>
<li>(ask) Why is obedience an expression of love?</li>
<li>Here I shared a story of when I wanted my son to do something specific, like wash his hands and come to the table for dinner. He wanted to clean of the sink, and the mirror, and take a long time. I got frustrated and told him to hurry up. He said something about wanting to help, to clean. I said I don&#8217;t want you to do that, I just want you to obey. In that experience, I caught a glimpse of what Heavenly Father must feel as He asks us to do things, and we try to do all of these extra or other things instead. He doesn&#8217;t want us to clean or whatever, He just wants us to obey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forms of the word &#8220;love&#8221; are used 34 times in John chapters 13-17. Two great expressions of love found in John chapter 12 and 13.</p>
<p><a title="John 12: 1-8" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/12/1-8" target="_blank"><strong>John 12: 1-8</strong></a> Mary annoints Jesus feet, using her hair to wash them. Think of the symbolism of using your hair to wash feet, the great love she must have had for him. Think of the Jewish tradition to wash a guest&#8217;s feet. They wore sandals at that time, walked everywhere on dirt streets which were shared with animals. A great show of love, and symbolic of the annointing of Jesus body after the crucifiction.</p>
<p><a title="John 13: 1-7" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/13/1-7" target="_blank"><strong>John 13: 1-7</strong></a> Jesus washes the feet of his apostles. Jesus, himself, was the guest, but put himself in the position as the servant by doing this service for his followers. It showed great love and set the example that leaders are to serve those who follow, not to be domineering over them. (see also <a title="JST John 13: 8-10" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/jst/96" target="_blank">JST John 13:8-10</a>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A CHANGE IN LOVE</span></strong></p>
<p>The old testament way of love is seen <a title="Leviticus 19: 18" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/lev/19/18#18" target="_blank">Leviticus 19: 18</a>. We are commanded to love others the same way we love ourselves, which is admittedly imperfect, speckled with thoughts of pride.</p>
<p>Jesus updates the commandment to love in <a title="John 13: 34-35" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/13/34-35/#34" target="_blank">John 13: 34-35</a>. Jesus commands us to love others as he loves us, unconditionally and absolutely.</p>
<ul>
<li>(ask) What&#8217;s the difference?</li>
</ul>
<p>President Howard W. Hunter taught: “We need to be kinder with one another, more gentle and more forgiving. We need to be slower to anger and more prompt to help. We need to extend the hand of friendship and resist the hand of retribution [revenge]. In short, we need to love one another with the pure love of Christ, with genuine charity and compassion and, if necessary, shared suffering, for that is the way God loves us” (<a href="http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1994.htm/ensign%20september%201994.htm/come%20to%20the%20god%20of%20all%20truth.htm?fn=default.htm$f=templates$3.0" target="_blank">“Come to the God of All Truth,” <em>Ensign,</em> Sept. 1994, 72</a>).</p>
<p><a title="John 14: 16-27" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/14/16-27/#16" target="_blank">John 14: 16-27</a> Jesus gives us promises for loving him.</p>

<li><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/luke/22/33-46/#33" target="_blank">Luke 23: 33-46</a> &#8211; the account of the crucifiction.  Christ giving His spirit to the Father. It shows love when you give of yourselft to someone else. You give children your time, your family time and attention. You give up your wants and needs for others. The greatest love is when you give up the greatest thing; your life, your will, your spirit.
<ul>
<li>Your life: great love, to cease  living for someone else.</li>
<li>Your will: greater love, to live as someone else wants you to.</li>
<li>Your spirit: greatest love, the direction of your eternal being, eternal life, is handed over to someone else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/15/13/#13" target="_blank">John 15: 13</a> Greatest love is laying down life for a friend. We are Christ&#8217;s friend when we do his will, do what he commands. He shows we are friends, and not servants because he tells us what he knows, from his Father, and keeps not what he knows from us. Laying down life doesn&#8217;t just mean dying for God, but more difficult is to <em>live</em> for God.</li>
<li><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/19/9-10/#9" target="_blank">1 Nephi 19: 9-10</a> It is great love when you allow ignorant people to cause you to suffer? Perhaps only when the outcome of that suffering is of greater importance than not suffering. Or the love is seen when you suffer at someone&#8217;s hands, but do not retaliate, seek revenge, or become vengeful.</li>
<li><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/34/1-4/#1" target="_blank">D&amp;C 34: 1-4</a> As we believe Jesus Christ, and to believe is to act and to become, we become His sons and daughters. This is possible because of His love for us in giving His own life for the cause, for the Plan. We hear, &#8220;you only have one life, one chance to be on this earth. You better use it well.&#8221; Some take that to mean party all you can. Others think, I best not mess it up, and so I should live righteously as a result. In each case the person makes choices, and regardless of desired outcome, many, if not most, of those choices are of a selfish and personal nature. They are to fulfill personal desires. Christ, on the other hand, was the ONLY person to live on this earth, and possibly and most probably on any other earth, to not live or make choices for himself. Instead everything he did was God&#8217;s will. As in <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/5/30/#30" target="_blank">John 5: 30</a>, He does nothing of his own self, not his will, but the will of the Father. This is even repeated three times: <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/4/34/#34" target="_blank">John 4: 34</a>; <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/5/30/#30" target="_blank">5: 30</a>; <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/6/38/#38" target="_blank">6: 38</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Fall:</strong></p>
<p>These three are absolutely necessary for our eternal progression, and follow one after another, and are dependent upon one another.</p>
<p>5 fundamental principles to understand the Fall:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/2/4/#4" target="_blank">2 Nephi 2:4</a> And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free. [There is a constant that outlives and exceeds this earth life and time frame.]</li>
<li>2 Nephi 2:4 The Fall was planned for as a central part of the Plan.</li>
<li>2 Nephi 2:4 Salvation is free. See <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/2_ne/9" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9</a></li>
<li>2 Nephi 2:5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever. [As descendants of Heavenly Father we all have the light of Christ in us. This means we all know right from wrong, good from evil.]</li>
<li>2 Nephi 2:5 By the law no flesh is justified.  This statement sets forth the need for a Redeemer. Justified means, in a theological sense, to be right with, or in order with God. It means to represent righteousness, to represent no sin. The law of justification states that breaking a commandments requires a punishment, and obedience gives blessings. No one is saved by the law because if you break the law, you have sin, and &#8220;no unclean thing can dwell&#8230; in His presence.&#8221; (see Moses 6:57). So by the law, as soon as we sin, our salvation is lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these fundamentals understood, there are two ways to reach the state our Father in Heaven has. 1) Fulfill all covenants and commandments and never sin during this phase in life. 2) Someone who has done number one pay the penalty for someone who has not.  Jesus Christ did the first, and IS the second for everyone else.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<a name="quote1"></a><strong>Quote 1</strong> <a href="#top">[ top ]</a><br />
For reasons that have not been revealed, this transition, or “fall,” could not happen without a transgression—an exercise of moral agency amounting to a willful breaking of a law (see Moses 6:59). This would be a planned offense, a formality to serve an eternal purpose. The Prophet Lehi explained that “if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen” (2 Ne. 2:22), but would have remained in the same state in which he was created.</p>
<p>“And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin” (2 Ne. 2:23).</p>
<p>But the Fall was planned, Lehi concludes, because “all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things” (2 Ne. 2:24).</p>
<p>It was Eve who first transgressed the limits of Eden in order to initiate the conditions of mortality. Her act, whatever its nature, was formally a transgression but eternally a glorious necessity to open the doorway toward eternal life. Adam showed his wisdom by doing the same. And thus Eve and “Adam fell that men might be” (2 Ne. 2:25).</p>
<p>Some Christians condemn Eve for her act, concluding that she and her daughters are somehow flawed by it. Not the Latter-day Saints! Informed by revelation, we celebrate Eve’s act and honor her wisdom and courage in the great episode called the Fall (see Bruce R. McConkie, “Eve and the Fall,” Woman, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979, pp. 67–68). Joseph Smith taught that it was not a “sin,” because God had decreed it (see The Words of Joseph Smith, ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980, p. 63). Brigham Young declared, “We should never blame Mother Eve, not the least” (in Journal of Discourses, 13:145). Elder Joseph Fielding Smith said: “I never speak of the part Eve took in this fall as a sin, nor do I accuse Adam of a sin. … This was a transgression of the law, but not a sin … for it was something that Adam and Eve had to do!” (Joseph Fielding Smith, Doctrines of Salvation, comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56, 1:114–15).</p>
<p>This suggested contrast between a sin and a transgression reminds us of the careful wording in the second article of faith: “We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression” (emphasis added). It also echoes a familiar distinction in the law. Some acts, like murder, are crimes because they are inherently wrong. Other acts, like operating without a license, are crimes only because they are legally prohibited. Under these distinctions, the act that produced the Fall was not a sin—inherently wrong—but a transgression—wrong because it was formally prohibited. These words are not always used to denote something different, but this distinction seems meaningful in the circumstances of the Fall.</p>
<p>Dallin H. Oaks, “<a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=3c4b425e0848b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1" target="_blank">The Great Plan of Happiness</a>,” Ensign, Nov 1993,  72</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
<a name="quote2"></a><strong>Quote 2</strong> <a href="#top">[ top ]</a><br />
Lucifer in clever ways manipulates our choices, deceiving us about sin and consequences. He, and his angels with him, tempt us to be unworthy, even wicked. But he cannot, in all eternity he cannot, with all his power he cannot completely destroy us; not without our own consent. Had agency come to man without the Atonement, it would have been a fatal gift.</p>
<p>We are taught in Genesis, in Moses, in Abraham, in the Book of Mormon, and in the endowment that man’s mortal body was made in the image of God in a separate creation. Had the Creation come in a different way, there could have been no Fall.</p>
<p>If men were merely animals, then logic favors freedom without accountability.</p>
<p>How well I know that among learned men are those who look down at animals and stones to find the origin of man. They do not look inside themselves to find the spirit there. They train themselves to measure things by time, by thousands and by millions, and say these animals called men all came by chance. And this they are free to do, for agency is theirs.</p>
<p>But agency is ours as well. We look up, and in the universe we see the handiwork of God and measure things by epochs, by eons, by dispensations, by eternities. The many things we do not know we take on faith.</p>
<p>But this we know! It was all planned before the world was. Events from the Creation to the final, winding-up scene are not based on chance; they are based on choice! It was planned that way.</p>
<p>Humbly I lay claim upon the atonement of Christ. I find no shame in kneeling down in worship of our Father and His son. For agency is mine, and this I choose to do!</p>
<p>Boyd K. Packer, “<a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=916dd7630a27b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1" target="_blank">Atonement, Agency, Accountability</a>,” Ensign, May 1988,  69</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
<a name="quote3"></a><strong>Quote 3</strong> <a href="#top">[ top ]</a><br />
Seventh, we should be aware that some people are more susceptible to some addictions than other people. Perhaps such susceptibility is inborn, like the unnamed ailment the Apostle Paul called &#8220;a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure&#8221; (2 Corinthians 12:7). One person has a taste for nicotine and is easily addicted to smoking. Another person cannot take an occasional drink without being propelled into alcoholism. Another person samples gambling and becomes a compulsive gambler.</p>
<p>Perhaps these persons, as the saying goes, were &#8220;born that way.&#8221; But what does this mean? Does it mean that persons with susceptibilities or strong tendencies have no choice, no free agency in these matters? Our doctrine teaches us otherwise. Regardless of a person&#8217;s susceptibility or tendency, his will is unfettered. His free agency is unqualified. It is his freedom that is impaired. Other persons are more free; though they unwisely sample the temptations, they seem immune to the addiction. But regardless of the extent of our freedom, we are all responsible for the exercise of our free agency.</p>
<p>As Lehi taught, in mortality we are only free &#8220;according to the flesh&#8221; (2 Nephi 2:27). Most of us are born with thorns in the flesh&#8211;some more visible, some more serious than others. We all seem to have susceptibilities to one disorder or another, but whatever our susceptibilities, we have the will and the power to control our thoughts and our actions. This must be so. God has said that he holds us accountable for what we do and what we think, so these must be controllable by our agency. Once we have reached the age or condition of accountability, &#8220;I was born that way&#8221; does not excuse actions or thoughts that fail to conform to the commandments of God. We need to learn how to live so that a weakness that is mortal will not prevent us from achieving the goal that is eternal.</p>
<p>God has promised that he will consecrate our afflictions for our gain (see 2 Nephi 2:2). The efforts we expend in overcoming an inherited weakness build spiritual strength that will serve us throughout eternity. Thus, when Paul prayed thrice that his &#8220;thorn in the flesh&#8221; would depart from him, the Lord replied, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&#8221; Obedient, Paul concluded,</p>
<p>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</p>
<p>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ&#8217;s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. [2 Corinthians 12:9­10]</p>
<p>Whatever our susceptibilities or tendencies, they cannot subject us to eternal consequences unless we exercise our free agency to do or think the things forbidden by the commandments of God. For example, a susceptibility to alcoholism impairs its victim&#8217;s freedom to partake without addiction, but his free agency allows him to abstain and thus escape the physical debilitation of alcohol and the spiritual deterioration of addiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=7014&amp;x=79&amp;y=11" target="_blank">Free Agency and Freedom</a>,&#8221; Dallin H. Oaks was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 October 1987.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[From my journal on  November 26, 2007]</p>
<p>Jan was having a hard time staying in bed tonight. When Jess went down to get water, she came in to ask me to put her blanket on her. I chose to ignore her because Jess had given Jan explicit instructions to stay in bed and consequences if she got out.</p>
<p>When Jess came up with the water, she found Jan in the hall. Jan started to cry and in a heart-broken voice told Jess how she came to talk to Daddy, but he wouldn&#8217;t talk to her, and didn&#8217;t turn his head to look at her. She was so sad. I almost ran out to hug her. She went to bed and stayed there for a while which allowed me to go tuck her in.</p>
<p>I thought I must know a little how God feels. How often do we try to ask God for things, but He can&#8217;t answer or look at us because we have chosen to be disobedient. He gives us commandments and consequences and He MUST abide by them. If He breaks them even once, even the smallest one, He would cease to be God.  He can not be the law giver and enforcer and break His own laws. I think I felt a bit of the heart ache He feels when He is bound to His laws and can not help because we have not kept our part of the bargain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, He is a merciful God and we can rectify our standing with Him when we apply the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Through repentance, continued obedience, and the cleansing power of the Atonement, we can have again a clean and pure relationship with our Father in Heaven.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>February 10, 2008  Sacrament meeting talk.  by Ammon Shepherd</p>
<p><strong>Charity</strong> = the highest, noblest, strongest kind of love; a prompting motive of actions. Charity is a defining quality, it creates change.<br />
<strong>Moroni 7:46-47</strong> &#8211; charity is the greatest of all;<br />
<strong>1 Corinthians 13:1-3</strong> &#8211; if I have ___ but not charity, I am nothing.<br />
<strong>Matthew 22:36-40</strong> &#8211; love is the greatest commandment. All other laws and the principle of having prophets rests and is built on this foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Christ’s Examples</strong><br />
Christ showed us the greatest examples of charity.  John 15:12-13 shows us the greatest act of charity.  Christ’s examples of charity come in great and small ways.</p>
<ul>
<li> Luke 22:41-44 &#8211; The great intercessory prayer shows His ultimate love for all of us.</li>
<li> Alma 7:11-13 &#8211; description of Atonement.</li>
<li> Luke 22:50-51 &#8211; heals the man’s ear</li>
<li> Luke 23:33-34 &#8211; (see footnote c) forgives those who crucify Him</li>
<li> 3 Nephi 17:2-7 &#8211; Jesus’ bowels are filled with mercy</li>
<li> John 8: 1-11 &#8211; Jesus does not condemn the woman, but loves her and forgives her as she repents.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of Christ’s examples point to one important requirement for developing and using charity in our interaction with others.  1 Corinthians 13:4-5 &#8211; suffereth long, envieth not, vaunteth not itself, not puffed up, seeketh not her own.  Moroni 7: 44 &#8211; meek and lowly in heart.  In order to have charity, one must be humble.</p>
<p>In thinking how Christ’s examples of charity can influence me, I came to think upon how we learn as humans and what motivates us.  Basically, how can I apply what I learned about Christ’s examples of charity in my own life?</p>
<p><strong>Physical Senses</strong><br />
There are varying levels of understanding, or ways to comprehend, the world we live in.  Babies primarily use the sense of taste.  Everything goes into their mouths.  That is how they compare new things with those they already know.  As they grow, children begin to rely more on their other senses too: touch, sight, smell and hear.  They are curious and want to touch and see EVERYTHING!  We learn, understand and believe things about life through these senses.  These are physical ways to understand, to learn, and to know.</p>
<p><strong>Six Motivators</strong><br />
There are additional ways to understand and learn which are mainly emotional.  As we grow older, we learn to rely on these senses as well.  These senses are what motivate us to do just about everything in life.  Like many things, they denote a progression from least to greatest, from bad to good to best.  As we move to higher levels of understanding and act the higher law, we fulfill his admonition in Matt 5:48 to be perfect even as the Father is.  We progress to be more like Christ (see Ether 12:48).  These six motivators are force, fear, rewards, duty, faith and love &#8211; or charity.</p>
<p><strong>External Motivators</strong><br />
The first three motivators (force, fear, and rewards) are external, they are applied to us, or we use them to gain control over others.  They are focused outwardly.  They are all a form of consequence.  We can see them most often used when a parent disciplines their children incorrectly and unwisely.  I know, I use these motivators my self all too often.  We often hear, “If you finish dinner you can have desert” or “No desert until you finish your dinner!” or “You’re going to finish dinner or else!”  In the grown up world we seem to be no better.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Motivators</strong><br />
There are better ways, higher ways, heavenly ways (duty, faith, and love).  As we climb the emotional motivator ladder, we reach the higher rungs where God dwells.  We begin to use the motivator that He uses, love &#8211; or charity.  These motivators do not seek to get others to do, but seek to prompt ourselves to action.  They are focused inwardly.  They ask, “What must I do to achieve results?” rather than “What must others do?” or “How can I make others change?”  This gets at the heart of Christ’s saying in Matt. 10:39 “He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.”</p>
<ul>
<li> Duty: D&amp;C 107: 99 &#8211; let every man learn his duty&#8230;  As we learn our duties, we put ourselves in a position to learn, understand, and grow.  “How can I do my part?” is what motivates us.</li>
<li> Faith: Ether 12:6 &#8211; Faith is an emotional motivator. We hope for an outcome we do not know for sure will happen.  We pay 10% of our income to the Church as tithing because of faith.  “What should I do?” is what we ask.</li>
<li> Charity:  Galatians 4:14 “For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”  Charity is the greatest commandment, the ultimate motivator, the eternal force.</li>
</ul>
<p>In trying circumstances, charity helps us suspect the best in others.  For example, when work is stressful and sleep is extra-needful, a crying baby throughout the night can make a parent want to pull out hair and scream with frustration and weariness.  But by applying the lens of charity to our view of he situation, we can filter our perspective, gain control of out thoughts and emotions, and act with love &#8211; even act as Christ would act.  We realize that a baby is continually learning.  He must learn to put himself back to sleep at night, must learn to be calm.  As a  parent, I am to teach that child.  There is no ill or malicious intent in a baby, and believe it or not, neither is there in small children.  Moroni teaches us in Moroni 8:8, little children are not capable of committing sin.  They are all in a learning process.  Our love for them and our level of charity will allow us to see their intentions as positive, and allow us to teach in a loving manner.</p>
<p><strong>Repentance is a gift of charity</strong><br />
We should not be discouraged when we find ourselves falling short and using the lesser motivators.  One of the greatest acts of charity that Christ gives us constantly is that of repentance.  Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said: “You can change anything you want to change and you can do it very fast. That’s another Satanic sucker-punch—that it takes years and years and eons of eternity to repent. It takes exactly as long to repent as it takes you to say ‘I’ll change’—and mean it. Of course there will be problems to work out and restitutions to make. You may well spend—indeed you had better spend—the rest of your life proving your repentance by its permanence. But change, growth, renewal, repentance can come for you as instantaneously as it did for Alma and the Sons of Mosiah” (“Tempering Our Tempers,” Ensign, Feb 2008, 54–57).</p>
<p><strong>Christ is the perfect example</strong><br />
Christ is the perfect example of every good thing.  As we look to Christ for examples of how to live our lives, we see that humility and charity will play a central role.  We truly “find our lives” by losing it for His sake.  Through charity we learn how to view or situations as God does.  There is always a choice in how we feel.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m reading in the <a title="Teachings for our Times, Joseph Smith Manaul" href="http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=05425f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=ae2720596a845110VgnVCM100000176f620a____" target="_blank">Joseph Smith Manual</a> about the signs of the second coming of Christ. Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>pestilence</li>
<li>war and bloodshed, sword, great wars, rumors of wars</li>
<li>moon will be turned into blood</li>
<li>famine</li>
<li>great destruction</li>
<li>great distress</li>
<li>judgements</li>
<li>&#8220;whenever you see the [rain]bow withdrawn, it shall be a token that there shall be famine, pestilence, and great distress among the nations, and that the coming of the Messiah is not far distant.&#8221;</li>
<li>Judah must return</li>
<li>Jerusalem must be rebuilt</li>
<li>temple must be rebuilt</li>
<li>water come out from under the temple</li>
<li>waters of the Dead Sea be healed [see Ezekiel 47: 1-9 for numbers 9-13]</li>
<li>signs in the heavens</li>
<li>signs on the earth</li>
<li>sun turned into darkness</li>
<li>earthquakes in divers places</li>
<li>seas heaving beyond their bounds</li>
<li>one grand sign of the Son of Man in heaven. But the world will say it is a planet or comet or something similar, but it will be &#8220;as the light of the morning cometh out of the east&#8221;</li>
<li>all flesh subject to suffer (righteous and wicked)</li>
</ol>
<p>There is probably more&#8230;</p>
