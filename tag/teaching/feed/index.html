<p>So, I got to thinking, what format do I want to use for my Monday-Wednesday-Friday, History 100 Western Civilization class? I landed on a discussion based lecture format for Monday and Wednesday, and what I&#8217;m calling a History Lab for Friday. The sciences have this same format. Lecture on two days a week, then go to a lab where you practice what was preached. I figured we could do the same thing with critical thinking skills taught by the humanities. Monday and Wednesday will be a bit of me talking about the time period, with a healthy dose of questions and comments from the students based on the reading they have done. Then on Friday we have a History Lab where we critically examine a primary document from the time period we are learning about. I&#8217;m open to other ideas on what to do during the History Lab. I&#8217;m excited to see if any students offer suggestions.</p>

<p>Today was our first History Lab, and it went very well, I think. I will get the students opinion on Monday, to make this exercise an all around learning experience. For today&#8217;s History Lab I divided the students into groups of five (any more than that gets a bit unmanageable). They each picked a popsicle stick I had in a cup at the front of the desk. There were five popsicle sticks with the same color, but a different &#8220;filter&#8221; written on each of the five sticks. The filters are the biases, or lenses through which to look at history. They included race, gender, science/technology, social class, art, religion, and politics/government. After the students organize into groups, I give them a primary source document to read together, then discuss the document based on the filter that they have. After enough time to allow individual groups to discuss, we discuss altogether as a class. To track participation, attendance and provide accountability, each group had to write a summary of their discussion on the back of the paper, including their names and which filter they had, to be turned in at the end of class.</p>
<p>This seemed to work out pretty well, and the students had great comments. We looked at &#8220;The Spartan Creed&#8221;, a poem written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrtaeus">Tyrtaeus</a> in the 7th Century B.C. (unfortunately no reliable source found, just this post in a <a href="http://www.grtbooks.com/exitfram.asp?idx=3&amp;yr=-5000&amp;aa=AA&amp;at=AA&amp;ref=tyrtaeus&amp;URL=http://www.armageddononline.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-11557.html">forum</a>). The most noticeable thing about this document is how heavily male centric it is. Granted, it&#8217;s a man writing about war, but there is absolutely no mention of a female. It can be implied by the use of the word &#8220;children&#8221;, but no fighting for the protection of wife and family, just city and children. Here are some of the comments the students made on their papers for a few of the filters.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1561" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1561" alt="2013-09-06 10.23.17" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-225x300.jpg 225w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-768x1024.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-250x333.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-112x150.jpg 112w, wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17-624x832.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-06-10.23.17.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1561" class="wp-caption-text">Directions are an absolute necessity for group work to function well.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gender: Men are dominant, only men are warriors. No reference to women. The society was very male dominated. Women had no role in the Spartan military, so the code is less relevant to them. Females are not even mentioned in the creed, so men are obviously the dominant gender. Among the men, they are expected to be strong, courageous, honorable, every trait that makes them a mighty soldier, a protector of their city-state.</p>
<p>Art: War is their art, the structure of their army, how they fought, etc. It doesn&#8217;t specifically say anything about art, but the way this is written is a form of art and the way the author makes out a man to be is like a piece of art.</p>
<p>Religion: War was treated as a religion. Soldiers were treated as gods when they returned. In death, a Spartan man becomes immortal as his memory is honored as if he is a god. To understand this one must know that in his life he was worshiped for being a good fighter and so that is carried over in a glorious death. Religion and personal values seem to all be related to war; gods are mentioned but the creed is centered around the personal honor of a warrior.</p>
<p>I was pleased with the results. All of the students were engaged in the group work and came up with something intelligent to write about. The beauty of this model is that each student has a focused purpose to look at a historical document, and then is held accountable for sharing something.</p>
<p>Do you have ideas for what we can do in our History Lab? Leave a comment below, and I&#8217;ll give it a try!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will invariably get a few questions about how I would teach modern European history as a professor. To prepare for these types of questions I wrote down (actually, I typed them all in, no pencil or paper used <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) the three nations I&#8217;m looking at and some themes, events, and books I would like to use in a course. I struggled with which people, if any to focus on.</p>
<p>A theoretical question I could be asked is: Say you have to teach a course on (Modern England, Modern France, Modern Germany, Modern Europe, World Wars in Europe, etc). What themes, events, people would you focus on and what books would you include? What would be the layout of the course?</p>
<p>I focus on individual countries below, and for a general European course, I would just draw from each of the countries. The books I pull from are only the ones on my Orals reading list. I would most likely supplement with other books after doing some research if I were really teaching a course.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that I probably would never just go chronologically through a time period to hit big events and &#8220;important&#8221; people. History is very subjective. We look back on events and information with a certain set of &#8220;filters&#8221; on. For example we view Germany with political filters, focusing on governments and politicians. Or we may focus on France with cultural filters, looking at food, society, entertainment and arts. It&#8217;s impossible to get a <em>full</em> picture or sense of the past. Just as it&#8217;s impossible to gain a full sense of the present. There&#8217;s just too many people, too many viewpoints, too many sides to the same story, and too many filters to encompass everything. What&#8217;s the point, then? The point is to do what we can. Find what interests you and study the past through that filter. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with learning about one slice of the pie, as long as we don&#8217;t think our slice represents the whole thing. With that said, then, I would probably pick a few themes and have the books, discussions and (unless totally unavoidable) lectures focus on those themes. See the very bottom of this post for a couple of teaching ideas.</p>

<p>French Revolution</p>
<p>Political changes through 1870 (republics, monarchies, and empires)</p>
<p>Third Republic</p>
<p>Colonialism</p>
<p>Dreyfus Affair</p>
<p>WWI &#8211; interwar &#8211; WWII</p>
<p>Fourth Republic</p>
<p>Algeria</p>
<p>Fifth Republic</p>
<p><strong>People:</strong></p>
<p>Napoleon, Dreyfus, de Gaulle, Petain,</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>
<p>Ford and Weber: compare different ways of looking at nationalism in  France. Bottom-up and Top-down show many ways and nationalism was  sculptured.</p>
<p>Hazareesingh: Argues that concepts of citizenship and a weaker state  government were first established during Second Empire, rather than in  Third Republic. Sources based on elite writings, so it shows what they  wanted, not necessarily what happened, since there was much restriction  of local governments and individual rights.</p>
<p>Nord: Unique way of looking at how Third Republic lasted so long, not  how it could end in Vichy. Shows how Third Republic implemented  political ideas that Hazareesingh shows the Second Empire wanted to use  (decentralized govt., create sense of citizenship, etc). Shows building  of &#8220;traditional&#8221; Victorian ideals about gender, public/private spheres,  middle-class bourgeois life shaped by and influenced politics in France.</p>
<p>McManners: to show the decline in religion, the issues of church and state (infalibility of pope)</p>
<p>Forth (or other book on Dreyfus Affair): Discuss why Dreyfus Affair  was so influential in France and elsewhere. The issues of antisemitism  in places other than Germany, and the masculinity complex in France and  Europe.</p>
<p>Prochaska: To show importance of colonies, especially Algeria, to  France. Stresses that Algeria was France, so issues there were similar  to issues in France. Perhaps also read with Horne about the Algerian  wars and end of France occupation to show the story from occupied and  occupiers.</p>
<p>Weber: Show the interwar years as decisive in France allowing Nazis so much influence in France.</p>
<p>Paxton and Rousso: Show the involvement of Vichy with Nazis, and the national conundrum that places on French narrative.</p>
<p>Hecht: To address the issue of France dealing with their national  image and turning to technology and technocrats as the source of  narrative building.</p>

<p>Fullbrook: formation and existence of East Germany.</p>
<p>Jarausch &amp; Geyer: How to deal with Germany&#8217;s past, and how best  to interpret and write history. Also a good book to address methodology,  how should historians write, there are too many ways to explain and  recount history than just political. OR Koshar for the same reasons, but  he focuses on buildings as monuments which provides a tangible  reference to the discussion rather than the theoretical discussion by  Jarausch &amp; Geyer.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>

<p>Nationalism is the biggest one. Look at political change, republics, democracies, socialism, and communism.</p>
<p>Decline in religion and the increased reliance in science. Modernization.</p>
<p>Economies  of scale. Global markets and capitalism vs socialism vs communism. Role  of Industrial Revolution and colonialism, class and gender.</p>
<p>Colonialism/imperialism as economic, political and cultural motivators.</p>
<p>Gender  issues. Defining gender in Victorian period, creation of &#8220;traditional  roles&#8221;, affect of industrial revolution and capitalism on changing role  of occupations. Changes in legal rights for women and men.</p>
<p>Rise in class consciousness, workers unions, political movements. Failure or success of communist ideals.</p>

<h3>Teaching Ideas</h3>
<p><strong>History Filters</strong></p>
<p>Study  of history is always dependent upon the &#8220;filter&#8221; through which you want  to look at it. It would be fun to divide the class into sections, and  each group take a specific &#8220;filter&#8221; (gender, culture, politics, economy,  class, race, etc). Each group either gets their own reading list or  they have to pull the specific themes from a general list. Then each  class period, each group takes a turn discussing history viewed through  their filter. Have the other groups not presenting write one question  before class and one question after for the presenting group to answer  about their &#8220;filter.&#8221; (Questions could be done on a blog.)</p>
<p><strong>Timelines</strong></p>
<p>Have students make a timeline of the time period the class will be    studying. Then in the first lecture share what my points are and argue    them. Have the students keep their timeline throughout the semester.    They will argue their points, especially if they change them, taking    ideas from the texts. Final paper is a well argued timeline.</p>
