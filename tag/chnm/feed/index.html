<p>In other news, there is now a growing movement to archive old skills that are no longer used.  Mr. Scoble started a list of <a href="http://obsoleteskills.com/Main/HomePage">obsolete skills</a> on his blog and later made a wiki about it.  Now everybody can contribute their obsolete skills.  Not only is this a humorous way to look at the evolving world of technology, but it provides a useful archive for anyone who might run across the need to use one of these obsolete skills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s with these multiple posts in a day&#8230;</p>
<p>Today marks the completion of my Multiple WordPress Updater Script. I&#8217;ve already posted a bunch about school stuff, might as well post about work stuff too.</p>
<p>We host over 55 blogs at <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu">CHNM</a>. It&#8217;s up to me to update them when security patches or new versions come out. Doing them each by hand is a pain. I did a bit of searching but didn&#8217;t find anything that would help me update so many sites automatically. So I wrote a bash script that will do it for me. It reads a file that lists all of the wordpress install paths or prompts you for the path to one, prompts for the version to switch to, and a mysql user/pass that has permissions for all databases.</p>
<p>Then the script creates a copy of the database, makes a copy of the wp-content folder, updates the wordpress install using subversion, fixes some permissions, and saves the subversion output to a file in your home directory (which I&#8217;ll probably change to somewhere&#8217;s else).</p>
<p>I run this via sudo as root for easy updating. What I&#8217;m really pleased with is that I figured out how to get the script to pull the database name from the wp-config.php file, and grab the owner and group for later fixing of the permissions.</p>
<p>I hope it can be useful to someone. If you have any comments or suggestions, let me know.</p>
<p>Latest Version: 1.2.3 &#8211; 04/29/08<br />
