										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will invariably get a few questions about how I would teach modern European history as a professor. To prepare for these types of questions I wrote down (actually, I typed them all in, no pencil or paper used <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) the three nations I&#8217;m looking at and some themes, events, and books I would like to use in a course. I struggled with which people, if any to focus on.</p>
<p>A theoretical question I could be asked is: Say you have to teach a course on (Modern England, Modern France, Modern Germany, Modern Europe, World Wars in Europe, etc). What themes, events, people would you focus on and what books would you include? What would be the layout of the course?</p>
<p>I focus on individual countries below, and for a general European course, I would just draw from each of the countries. The books I pull from are only the ones on my Orals reading list. I would most likely supplement with other books after doing some research if I were really teaching a course.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that I probably would never just go chronologically through a time period to hit big events and &#8220;important&#8221; people. History is very subjective. We look back on events and information with a certain set of &#8220;filters&#8221; on. For example we view Germany with political filters, focusing on governments and politicians. Or we may focus on France with cultural filters, looking at food, society, entertainment and arts. It&#8217;s impossible to get a <em>full</em> picture or sense of the past. Just as it&#8217;s impossible to gain a full sense of the present. There&#8217;s just too many people, too many viewpoints, too many sides to the same story, and too many filters to encompass everything. What&#8217;s the point, then? The point is to do what we can. Find what interests you and study the past through that filter. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with learning about one slice of the pie, as long as we don&#8217;t think our slice represents the whole thing. With that said, then, I would probably pick a few themes and have the books, discussions and (unless totally unavoidable) lectures focus on those themes. See the very bottom of this post for a couple of teaching ideas.</p>

<h2>France</h2>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong></p>
<p>Political revolutions, class changes, colonialism, gender, religion, memory, nationalism, antisemitism</p>
<p><strong>Events:</strong></p>
<p>French Revolution</p>
<p>Political changes through 1870 (republics, monarchies, and empires)</p>
<p>Third Republic</p>

<p>Napoleon, Dreyfus, de Gaulle, Petain,</p>
<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>
<p>Ford and Weber: compare different ways of looking at nationalism in  France. Bottom-up and Top-down show many ways and nationalism was  sculptured.</p>
<p>Hazareesingh: Argues that concepts of citizenship and a weaker state  government were first established during Second Empire, rather than in  Third Republic. Sources based on elite writings, so it shows what they  wanted, not necessarily what happened, since there was much restriction  of local governments and individual rights.</p>
<p>Nord: Unique way of looking at how Third Republic lasted so long, not  how it could end in Vichy. Shows how Third Republic implemented  political ideas that Hazareesingh shows the Second Empire wanted to use  (decentralized govt., create sense of citizenship, etc). Shows building  of &#8220;traditional&#8221; Victorian ideals about gender, public/private spheres,  middle-class bourgeois life shaped by and influenced politics in France.</p>
<p>McManners: to show the decline in religion, the issues of church and state (infalibility of pope)</p>
<p>Forth (or other book on Dreyfus Affair): Discuss why Dreyfus Affair  was so influential in France and elsewhere. The issues of antisemitism  in places other than Germany, and the masculinity complex in France and  Europe.</p>
<p>Prochaska: To show importance of colonies, especially Algeria, to  France. Stresses that Algeria was France, so issues there were similar  to issues in France. Perhaps also read with Horne about the Algerian  wars and end of France occupation to show the story from occupied and  occupiers.</p>
<p>Weber: Show the interwar years as decisive in France allowing Nazis so much influence in France.</p>
<p>Paxton and Rousso: Show the involvement of Vichy with Nazis, and the national conundrum that places on French narrative.</p>

<p>Colonialism/imperialism as economic, political and cultural motivators.</p>
<p>Gender  issues. Defining gender in Victorian period, creation of &#8220;traditional  roles&#8221;, affect of industrial revolution and capitalism on changing role  of occupations. Changes in legal rights for women and men.</p>
<p>Rise in class consciousness, workers unions, political movements. Failure or success of communist ideals.</p>

<h3>Teaching Ideas</h3>
<p><strong>History Filters</strong></p>
<p>Study  of history is always dependent upon the &#8220;filter&#8221; through which you want  to look at it. It would be fun to divide the class into sections, and  each group take a specific &#8220;filter&#8221; (gender, culture, politics, economy,  class, race, etc). Each group either gets their own reading list or  they have to pull the specific themes from a general list. Then each  class period, each group takes a turn discussing history viewed through  their filter. Have the other groups not presenting write one question  before class and one question after for the presenting group to answer  about their &#8220;filter.&#8221; (Questions could be done on a blog.)</p>
<p><strong>Timelines</strong></p>
<p>Have students make a timeline of the time period the class will be    studying. Then in the first lecture share what my points are and argue    them. Have the students keep their timeline throughout the semester.    They will argue their points, especially if they change them, taking    ideas from the texts. Final paper is a well argued timeline.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<h3>How did the Industrial Revolution affect British society and politics?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-500" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-500" title="Steam Engine" alt="" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-300x228.jpg" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-300x228.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-250x190.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-150x114.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1-624x475.jpg 624w, wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steam-engine1.jpg 656w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-500" class="wp-caption-text">Steam Engine. From the Almanach comique, pittoresque, drolatique, critique et charivarique pour l&#8217;annÃ©e 1887, published in Paris.</figcaption></figure>
<h4>Changes in Lower Classes</h4>
<p>As E.P. Thompson&#8217;s book title suggests, the Industrial Revolution created a new socially aware and politically active group, or class of people. And it created more than one. E.P. focuses on the worker class that was established as people became workers in factories. The Industrial Revolution also created a new middle class of merchants and businessmen.</p>
<p>Industrial Revolution also changed trades. The weavers were the hardest hit. Once a respectable and well paid trade, after industry replaced people with machines, weaver trade was poorly paid and dishonorable. Positions opened up for women and children to work in factories. People moved to more urban areas. F.M.L. Thompson argues though, that these modes of urbanization were already in place and were not affected by industrialization.</p>
<p>This bespeaks a fear seen in all levels of society: the fear of change, the fear of technology, the dominance of machine over man.</p>
<h4>Organizations Lead to Political Activism</h4>
<p>This working class eventually formed unions to deal with issues in the factories, and such organization and collaboration in factory politics spilled out into the politics of government as they eventually sought redresses with Parliament. Dorothy Thompson writes about such a movement known as Chartism, that happened in the 1830s and 1840s. Chartism was a movement of varying and differing causes, with the intent of a better society, fueled by the long unhappy workingmen throughout the country.</p>
<h4>Middle Class Changes in Society</h4>
<p>The middle classes created their own sphere in English society. Wanting to emulate the aristocracy, they embraced the idea of the gentleman and created a culture of private and public spheres for women and men, codes of conduct and beliefs. Industry began a continual decent in the late nineteenth century as the middle class (the owners of industrial factories, the merchants and businessmen) abandon capitalist notions and seek the leisurely life of the gentleman. One argument is that the decline in British industrialism was a direct result of the middle class emulating the aristocracy instead of overcoming them (socially and politically) (Wiener).</p>

<h4>Historians and the Industrial Revolution</h4>
<p>How historians view the Industrial Revolution shows how history telling is affected by modern economic, political and social atmospheres. Four phases of interpretation show that the Industrial Revolution was viewed as a negative consequence of human behavior; a cyclical process of nature tied to war and economic challenges; a process for economic growth; and most recently as nothing more than anticipated economic and technological evolution.</p>
<h4><strong>Why does E.P. Thompson hate the standard of living debate?</strong></h4>
<p>Thompson looks at the standard of living between 1790-1840. The biggest issue is that historians sympathetic to capitalist entrepreneurship used the data to match their conclusions, rather than to discover what was there. (Like looking for red cars and noticing how many there are, to the exclusion of noticing all the other colors.) This issue leads to three other issues with historical the look at the standard of living.</p>
<p>1. Historians did not take into consideration that quantity can increase and quality can decrease at the same time. Economic historians take the rise in wages and goods and deduce that quality of live increases too. Social historians look at the writings about poor quality of life and deduce that material wealth declined as well. Thompson argues that the Industrial Revolution brought increase in material goods (wages, products, etc) but the &#8220;well-being&#8221; of workers decreased (decreased leisure time, less independence, longer working hours, etc) (211).</p>
<p>2. Taking an average dilutes the actual findings. Adding the stats for all counties and then dividing by the number of counties to find an &#8220;average&#8221; ignores the discrepancies within the counties. One county may be very rich, another very poor, but combining their info and dividing by their numbers does not provide an accurate description of how those counties actually were (213-214).</p>
<p>3. Quality is subject to interpretation and dependent upon the group you&#8217;re looking at (gentlemen, poor, workers, laborers, etc)</p>
