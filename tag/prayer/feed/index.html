										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m trying to improve my prayers. I want to move away from the rote and repetitive one-sided speech I have now, and have a conversation with Heavenly Father. I read in John 11, today, where Jesus rose Lazarus from the dead. As he stood before the open tomb, Jesus said aloud to his Father that he was thankful he had heard him (v <a title="John 11: 41-42" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/john/11/41-42#41" target="_blank">41-42</a>). This presupposes that Jesus had a conversation with his Father before hand. He obviously had the best relationship with Heavenly Father out of all people who have ever lived on the earth. His example is to be emulated. So how can I improve my prayers and my relationship with God?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to do a study of prayer in the scriptures. I&#8217;m going to note all instances of people praying and conversing with God, and then study and analyze the results in an effort to improve my own relationship with God. My favorite words about prayer come from the <a title="Bible Dictionary" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/contents" target="_blank">Bible Dictionary</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father, and we are his children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part (<a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/matt/7/7-11#7">Matt. 7: 7-11</a>). Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them. Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work, and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings. [<a title="Prayer - Bible Dictionary page 54" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/p/54" target="_blank">Prayer, Bible Dictionary</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>It is this type of relationship that I want to have, my will being brought into correspondence with the Father&#8217;s.</p>
