										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will invariably get a few questions about how I would teach modern European history as a professor. To prepare for these types of questions I wrote down (actually, I typed them all in, no pencil or paper used <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) the three nations I&#8217;m looking at and some themes, events, and books I would like to use in a course. I struggled with which people, if any to focus on.</p>
<p>A theoretical question I could be asked is: Say you have to teach a course on (Modern England, Modern France, Modern Germany, Modern Europe, World Wars in Europe, etc). What themes, events, people would you focus on and what books would you include? What would be the layout of the course?</p>
<p>I focus on individual countries below, and for a general European course, I would just draw from each of the countries. The books I pull from are only the ones on my Orals reading list. I would most likely supplement with other books after doing some research if I were really teaching a course.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that I probably would never just go chronologically through a time period to hit big events and &#8220;important&#8221; people. History is very subjective. We look back on events and information with a certain set of &#8220;filters&#8221; on. For example we view Germany with political filters, focusing on governments and politicians. Or we may focus on France with cultural filters, looking at food, society, entertainment and arts. It&#8217;s impossible to get a <em>full</em> picture or sense of the past. Just as it&#8217;s impossible to gain a full sense of the present. There&#8217;s just too many people, too many viewpoints, too many sides to the same story, and too many filters to encompass everything. What&#8217;s the point, then? The point is to do what we can. Find what interests you and study the past through that filter. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with learning about one slice of the pie, as long as we don&#8217;t think our slice represents the whole thing. With that said, then, I would probably pick a few themes and have the books, discussions and (unless totally unavoidable) lectures focus on those themes. See the very bottom of this post for a couple of teaching ideas.</p>

<p>Hazareesingh: Argues that concepts of citizenship and a weaker state  government were first established during Second Empire, rather than in  Third Republic. Sources based on elite writings, so it shows what they  wanted, not necessarily what happened, since there was much restriction  of local governments and individual rights.</p>
<p>Nord: Unique way of looking at how Third Republic lasted so long, not  how it could end in Vichy. Shows how Third Republic implemented  political ideas that Hazareesingh shows the Second Empire wanted to use  (decentralized govt., create sense of citizenship, etc). Shows building  of &#8220;traditional&#8221; Victorian ideals about gender, public/private spheres,  middle-class bourgeois life shaped by and influenced politics in France.</p>
<p>McManners: to show the decline in religion, the issues of church and state (infalibility of pope)</p>
<p>Forth (or other book on Dreyfus Affair): Discuss why Dreyfus Affair  was so influential in France and elsewhere. The issues of antisemitism  in places other than Germany, and the masculinity complex in France and  Europe.</p>
<p>Prochaska: To show importance of colonies, especially Algeria, to  France. Stresses that Algeria was France, so issues there were similar  to issues in France. Perhaps also read with Horne about the Algerian  wars and end of France occupation to show the story from occupied and  occupiers.</p>
<p>Weber: Show the interwar years as decisive in France allowing Nazis so much influence in France.</p>
<p>Paxton and Rousso: Show the involvement of Vichy with Nazis, and the national conundrum that places on French narrative.</p>

<h3>Teaching Ideas</h3>
<p><strong>History Filters</strong></p>
<p>Study  of history is always dependent upon the &#8220;filter&#8221; through which you want  to look at it. It would be fun to divide the class into sections, and  each group take a specific &#8220;filter&#8221; (gender, culture, politics, economy,  class, race, etc). Each group either gets their own reading list or  they have to pull the specific themes from a general list. Then each  class period, each group takes a turn discussing history viewed through  their filter. Have the other groups not presenting write one question  before class and one question after for the presenting group to answer  about their &#8220;filter.&#8221; (Questions could be done on a blog.)</p>
<p><strong>Timelines</strong></p>
<p>Have students make a timeline of the time period the class will be    studying. Then in the first lecture share what my points are and argue    them. Have the students keep their timeline throughout the semester.    They will argue their points, especially if they change them, taking    ideas from the texts. Final paper is a well argued timeline.</p>

<p>England, France and Germany saw war as a glorious engagement. The  prevailing thought by those who joined the military was that they would  be home by Christmas. Young men were bored with the good quality of life  so were eager to prove themselves and their new sense of national  identity. Because of advancements in technology (machine guns, tanks,  large guns, airplane) and changes in fighting (trench warfare, volunteer  army rather than conscripts) the war lasted much, much longer and was  much more devastating than planned. As secularism replaced religion, war  was the natural or scientific way to show nationalism and patriotism.</p>
<p>There  is much contention, at least among German historians, about numerous  points leading up to the First World War. For German historians, the  issues stem around the internal or external focus of the Wilhelmine  government, the relative versus the actual influence and power of the  lower classes over the ruling elite, and when Germany first made a  decision to go to war, and the contentions surrounding German  preparations for war. Volker Berghahn provides an excellent discussion  on the historiography of Germany leading up to World War I. Refuting any  attempts at placing a Sonderweg to Nazi Germany, Berghahn argues that  Germany did not face different paths than other European countries, they  just made different choices. In other words, Germans faced the same  choices, they just reacted differently than other countries. Berghahn  shows how internal pressures from an &#8220;unstable&#8221; government (a rise in  the Social Democratic party demanding more power in the Reichstag for  the lower classes and an obdurate ruling elite unwilling to give up  power)Â  and external pressures from countries who sought to keep Germany  restrained, eventually left German leaders feeling they had no other  alternative than to create what they hoped would be a small internal war  that would unify and subdue German speaking areas politically, and  provide breathing room for lack of ability to colonize off continent.  German leaders felt they were not able to decide if a war would happen,  so they chose to decide when it would happen.</p>
<p>The war that  followed came as a shock to all participants. Everything came in greater  and staggering numbers. Loss of life in a single battle was immense  compared to previous wars. The war left a lasting and different  impression on each nation. War afflicted nearly half of all men in  France, and turned them into ultra pacifists. Their desire to refrain  from all future conflict led directly to complicit attitudes towards the  future Nazi party. Germans felt stabbed in the back and let resentment  and unfair reparations requirements foster in their culture. Forced to  employ a democratic government and divert a great percentage of their  economy to their enemies, Germany plunged much deeper into economic  depression and hyper inflation than other countries of the world that  experience the Great Depression. Germans became more politically  militant instead of democratic, and were left pining for the &#8220;Golden  Days&#8221; before the war.</p>
<p>And the British&#8230; I haven&#8217;t read about them past 1914.</p>
<p>Take a look at the picture below, drawn by Harris Morgan and submitted to wikimedia.org. I think it sums up nicely the different factors that led to the First World War. Perhaps one of the logs should be labeled &#8220;German political discord&#8221;. All of these external factors, plus the internal pressure of political change, fanned by the euphoric ideals of nationalism and trying to beat someone else (the arms race), led to a very uncivil expression of emotion.</p>

It most often encompasses  development and use of mechanical technology, a change in gender roles,  a real or perceived rise in standard of living, adjustments in social  classes, and, often, political change. Modernization at times was seen  in different ways including: a detriment to human society, a marvelous  improvement to society, an effect of economic and political challenges,  and, most recently, as an inevitable evolution of progress.</p>

<p>Modernism in England can be seen in all these ways in the nineteenth  century. The Industrial Revolution, as pointed out by E. P. Thompson had  a great impact on the social and economic status of the poor as whole  industries turned to machines in factories and entire occupations (think  weavers) were discontinued. Formation of factory unions lead to a  politically emboldened populace. The Victorian period is known for the  ideals of separate spheres for men (political, public, and occupational)  and women (private, nurturing) that are still observed and discussed  and contested to this day. As Robert Wohl writes, these Victorian ideals  are what caused many young individuals (in England, France and Germany)  during the turn of the century to question the role of authority and  the place of such ideals. English technological modernism during the  19th century was hampered by the desire of the business classes to  emulate the aristocracy. Martin Wiener writes that this English  pastoralism affected the economy by not allowing it to grow as in other  countries. Another form of modernist government was seen in England as  Parliament enacted many laws that directly interfered with individuals.  Laws governing the poor, woman&#8217;s rights, education, and voting abilities  all showed, for better or worse, a government with more interest in  their citizens.</p>

<p>If modernization is characterized primarily by use of technology,  especially of an industrial revolution, then Germany got off to a late  start comparatively. But following the unification and  industrialization in late 19th Century, Germany showed great progress.  Advances in aviation with Zeppelin, in art with the Bauhaus movement are  just two of the many examples. Politically Germany changed from a group  of loosely connected principalities to become a federated nation with,  albeit very weak, parliamentary government. At the turn of the century,  German youth were struggling with the sense of modernism and formed many  youth groups to express concern with political and social issues.  Germany showed a peculiar sense of modernization during the Third Reich.  Whereas Nazi ideology extolled the life of the peasant, the simple life  of the Volk, seemingly anti-modern, they still exhibited very modern  practices. The building of the Autobahns, the development of the first  ballistic missile, the successful flights of the first jet powered  aircraft were all seemingly contradictory to basic Nazi ideology.</p>

<p>During  the bifurcation years, West Germany enjoyed the status of a  technologically advanced and modern country. East Germany suffered the  stigma of a backwards and inept Soviet satellite country, incapable of  keeping up with modern technologies. Stokes shows, though, that East  Germany maintained technical competence through the length of its  existence (longer than the Third Reich, Weimar Republic and Imperialism,  a testament to a successful country with successful technologies such  as the Trabant, optics, and computers. What didn&#8217;t work in East Germany  was the political desire to keep up with western technology, but the  ineptness at maintaining a supportive economy, due in part to Soviet  inability or unwillingness to support East German technologies. East  Germany, in effect, sought to specialize in the fringe technologies of  the west, but did not have the underlying infrastructure to support  them.</p>

<p>Modernization in the political sense has been attributed to  the French Revolution. Changes between monarchies (and empires) to  republics throughout the early 19th century sparked the social and  political movements in Europe towards self-governed people (something  which the nobility and educated classes thought undesirable and  potentially devastating). As the Second Empire moved into the Third  Republic, self-government began in earnest, as national governments  allowed local governments more control. National governments also became  more interested in the individual citizens, much the same as in  England, as they enacted laws restricting religion and regulating  education. As always a factor, the Dreyfus Affair showed a nation  struggling with the society and the ideals that came out of political  change. Continual losses (Franco-Prussian, WWI and WWII) to Germany and  colonial troubles led France to desperately look towards modern  technology, such as nuclear power, to regain international standing, and  create a positive national narrative.</p>

I think it is the mindset and ideals that came after monarchy lost it&#8217;s status as the representation of a people in many European countries. With a king or queen, royalty was the embodiment of the subjects. They represented their country, they were their country. Before, they had a sense of Queen Elizabeth I from sixteenth century, that she is the heart of England. When the political tide turned to constitutional monarchies or republics the people felt the monarchies did not truly represent the new organization created. Nationalism is the idea that stepped in to fill the void. As Benedict Anderson writes, the concept of a nation is imagined because it is a community of members that will not know or meet all other members, it is limited because it has a definite if elastic boundary where other nations begin, it is sovereign because the people involved are what give it power and authority, and it is a community in that it assumes a &#8220;horizontal comradeship&#8221; despite actual inequalities. This new concept of organization of individuals into a community based on political determinism leads to followers willing to kill, but more importantly, willing to die for the ideal. It&#8217;s as if a country, because of the new political organization, became one big family, and instead of having subjects, they are all siblings and relatives. Nationalism also seemed to take on a role of the new religion. As people turned from their Christian roots and became more secular, nationalism provided a sense of unity and an ideal to strive for.</p>

All throughout the nineteenth century the various Republics that arise are trying to create this unified &#8220;Frenchness&#8221; throughout the country. Weber, Ford and Nord write about it. The issues of the periphery versus the center that come to play in Weber and Ford are all about creating a unified language, culture, system of measurement, etc, in an effort to create what it means to be &#8220;French&#8221;. This is, in essence, what nationalism is. Defining what makes a group of people similar to each other, and what makes them different from the others. The Dreyfus Affair shows worries about how the &#8220;Frenchness&#8221; is turning out. Are they becoming to feminized and weak as Forth shows? Hecht shows the concern about the place of French nationalism after World War II in terms of nuclear technology. France feels they can regain their status as one of the major nations of the world by proving themselves capable of nuclear technology. France was/is very aware of the other nations, continuously in the late nineteenth century comparing population growth and manliness.</p>

Colonizing in the nineteenth century turned from a desire for free trade to a new form of imperialism, the British expanded because it was morally right to educate and enlighten other nations. In the Victorian period, the British were also focused internally. The forays of the upper-classes into the lower classes for philanthropic reasons, the desire of Parliament to enact laws to regulate education and to an extent family life, all show how the nation, or state, was considered to be the fatherly figure that knew best how to care for his children, the citizens.</p>
<p><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/81px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R68588_Otto_von_Bismarck.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-790 alignleft" title="81px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R68588,_Otto_von_Bismarck" alt="" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/81px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R68588_Otto_von_Bismarck.jpg" width="81" height="120" /></a>German nationalism came considerably later than France and England. Unity in Germany did not come until 1870s with Prussia. Here we see a definite creation of a German nation. Whereas before there were many separate and distinct principalities, the unification under Bismark and Prussia literally created, reluctantly at times, a unified German nation. Throughout Imperial Germany and through World War I, the German sense of nationalism was built on a unifying government and language. Various events during the early twentieth century led to a greater sense of unity, such as Zeppelin&#8217;s air ships.<a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/800px-Zeppelin_LZ4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-785 alignright" title="800px-Zeppelin_LZ4" alt="" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/800px-Zeppelin_LZ4-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a> Of most consolidating force was the German experience in World War I. The feelings of unity and comradeship overcame political and religious boundaries leading up to the war. As the War efforts became unfruitful, feelings of nationalism declined into feelings of betrayal and into political fracturing that endured the Weimar period. The rise of the Nazis was in part due to their appeal to the sense of recapturing the essence of the Volk, the people. Feelings of national unity rose during the Nazi period. After World War II, Germany went through a period unique to any modern European nation. Division into East and West German nations led to vary different national narratives and senses of nationality. Re-unification in 1990 collapsed one national narrative and modified the remaining one.</p>
