										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, this was my first ever <a href="http://thatcamp.org/">THATCamp</a> experience. Seems hard to imagine since I have worked at CHNM since before the inception of THATCamp.  Ah, well, the stars finally aligned, and was able to attend this year. And it was great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attended three <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/">workshops</a> on Friday, and a <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/11/a-better-blogging-assignment/">couple</a> of <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/15/shell-tutorial/">sessions</a> on Saturday. Here are some thoughts&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/#data-mining">Digital Data Mining with Weka</a>: This was a neat <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~hrangwal/dhdm">crash course</a> on what data mining is and is not, and one free tool to help do some of that. It was more of a &#8220;here&#8217;s what&#8217;s out there, how does it apply to the humanities&#8221; than a hands on, hands dirty, do some real work type of work shop. But it was good in that it opened up the possibility to do some data mining in the future. Since they were relatively small, here my notes:</p>
<p>What is data mining?</p>
<p>examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>recommend ads, products to users based on purchases</li>
<li>finding patterns in large amounts of text (writing algorithms to find those patterns)</li>
</ul>
<p>Goal of data mining is to predict what users/people will do based on data from other users/people</p>
<p>Data mining Tasks: classification, clustering, association rule discovery, sequential pattern discovery, regression, deviation detection</p>
<p>Goal is to predict the classification (or whatever) of future data, based on the current data that you analyze.</p>
<p>Cross validation (when done correctly you get true results, when not done correctly you get false results)</p>
<p>have multiple sets of data, one for training and the other for testing. Build the algorithm on the training data, then run it on the test. Then cycle through each testing data set and have it act as a training set. Do this way because you know the results for each, so you can tell if your algorithm is correct. When it&#8217;s good then you can use it on future data where you don&#8217;t know the result.</p>
<p><a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/workshops/#git">Interesting Things You Can Do With Gi</a>t: This one was highly anticipated. I have been wanting/needing to learn git for a while now. For being in the IT field, having written some code, and even having a GitHub account with code on it, I&#8217;m ashamed to say I still don&#8217;t know how to use git effectively. There is not much you can do in 1.5 hours, and this was more a theoretical &#8220;here are some ideas&#8221;, than a &#8220;here is how to do it&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>The session on using <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/11/a-better-blogging-assignment/">blogs as assignments</a> was maybe a bit premature for me. The session was really good, great ideas, tips, etc. But me teaching is still too far away for me to have put the mental effort in to following along much. I spent most of the time trying to find a good twitter client, but in the end just stuck with <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>.</p>
<p>Then I took some time to enjoy the hacker space. I decided it was time, and this was the perfect place to set up a transcription tool for my dissertation archive. So sitting at the very table where it is coded, I installed the <a href="http://scripto.org/">Scripto</a> plugin for Omeka. That&#8217;s a bit of a misnomer, since it is really a wrapper that lets Omeka and a Wikimedia install play nicely together. I went ahead and transcribed one of the documents in the archive as well. The archive is just in the testing phase, but here it is anyways: <a href="http://nazitunnels.org/archive">http://nazitunnels.org/archive</a></p>
<figure id="attachment_1261" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1261" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://nazitunnels.org/archive/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1261  " title="Screen Shot 2012-06-18 at 4.50.06 PM" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM.png" alt="" width="780" height="658" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM.png 975w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-300x252.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-250x210.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-150x126.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-18-at-4.50.06-PM-624x526.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1261" class="wp-caption-text">Nazi Tunnels Archive</figcaption></figure>
<p>The final event of THATCamp for me was one last session proposed by a fellow &#8220;camper&#8221;. She wanted help <a href="http://chnm2012.thatcamp.org/06/15/shell-tutorial/">learning about the shell</a>/terminal/command line. So I volunteered to help out with that. It ended up that there were about eight people that wanted help learning the command line, and four of us that knew what we were doing. So it ended up being a great ratio of help needed to those who could offer it. We started with the very basics, didn&#8217;t get much past a few commands (ls, cd, rm, nano, grep, cat), but we went slow enough that everybody who was trying to follow along was able to, and they all left with a clearer understanding of what the shell is for, and why it is useful. The proposer found a <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">great tutorial/book for learning the command line</a> that I&#8217;ll have to go through as well. You can always learn something new.</p>
<p>What was also great about that session, since it was basically ran by those who needed the help, I saw how those who struggle with these concepts learn them, so I will hopefully be better able to teach them to others in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I forgot to mention the many cool sites and projects mentioned during Saturday morning&#8217;s Dork Shorts. Here&#8217;s a list of the ones I took notice of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met with my Dissertation adviser last week, and we decided that the topic I had picked really had nothing to do with my dissertation. I don&#8217;t know why, but I had always been afraid to just bite off a chunk of the dissertation and give that a go. But after talking with Prof. Deshmukh, it should be quite doable.</p>
<figure id="attachment_388" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-388" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium  wp-image-388 " title="Albert-Speer-72-929" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415-240x300.jpg 240w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415-250x311.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415-120x150.jpg 120w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Albert-Speer-72-929-e1267581304415.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-388" class="wp-caption-text">Albert Speer at Nuremburg Trials. Image from Wikimedia Commons.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So the dissertation is the Nazi tunnels, and this paper will be an important part of that. One of the two organizations that looked into, and actually built some of the planned tunnels was the Reichsministerium für Rüstung und Kreigsproduktion (RMfRuK, Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production). This group was headed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Speer">Albert Speer</a>, who incidentally was a very interesting man. Anyhow, my paper will now look at the Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production. It will kind of be an historical overview of the organization and several key players in the building of the tunnels.</p>
<p>As we were discussing each others papers in class last night, the question kept coming around to what is the so what question, or why is this important for us to know. I went last, so we were all ready to just get out of class, and we didn&#8217;t really get to that part of mine. Which I&#8217;m kind of glad for, since I don&#8217;t really have one. Why is this important for us to know? Because it helps us understand the tunnel? Does that work?</p>
<p>At any rate, such is my new topic, it applies directly to my dissertation, and will be part of a chapter that discusses the organizations involved in building the tunnels.</p>
<figure id="attachment_393" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-393" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-393" title="800px-US_National_Archives_II" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-300x221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-300x221.jpg 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-250x184.jpg 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-150x110.jpg 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II-624x460.jpg 624w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/800px-US_National_Archives_II.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-393" class="wp-caption-text">US National Archives at College Park. Image from Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure>
<p>This, of course, means that all of my sources and bibliography need to be redone. I was a bit worried about sources, which is probably why I didn&#8217;t want to do the topic. Well, it turns out that Prof. Deshmukh has copies of the indexes to the Guides to German Records Microfilmed at Alexandria, VA, which are the captures Nazi documents housed at the U.S. National Archives. It just so happens that there are over 1000 rolls of microfilm that reference the RMfRuk (with over 190 being the records of this organization directly)! What a find. Now my extra hours will be spent going over the hundreds of pages of the indexes looking for references to Speer, Himmler, Kammler and tunnels. And then it&#8217;s off to the National Archives in College Park, Maryland to look at the actual documents. I have a lot to do before the April 12 deadline of the first draft (which should be as complete as possible).</p>
<p>So, if you didn&#8217;t get it yet, here are the steps to doing such a research paper:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an interesting topic. It has to hold your attention, or you will be miserable.</li>
<li>Talk to your Professors. They&#8217;ll point you on the right track for all kinds of things (sources, topic focus, secondary literature, encouragement, etc).</li>
<li>Find the sources. Best is to find an index or something that describes the sources. For my example, before I even go to the National Archives, I will have a list of specific rolls of microfilm I need, with particular documents I want to look at on the films. Hopefully my bank account can sustain the copies needed, or better yet, I&#8217;ll be able to make digital copies.</li>
<li>Find secondary literature about any aspect of your topic. In my case I need books and articles about Albert Speer, the RMfRuk, Nazi organizations, industrial and economic studies of Nazi Germany, etc.</li>
<li>Look the the secondary material for insights, information, and most importantly, more sources. I&#8217;m now see how important footnotes are, and can see what resources are most often used, what works are most often cited, and who makes what arguments. Harvesting the footnotes for sources is integral in historical research.</li>
<li>Gather information from primary and secondary sources and make an outline of the argument.</li>
<li>Write, write, write, and then do some more writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I am back to step 3, finding the sources. I&#8217;m going to the Archives on Friday. Wish me luck!</p>

<p>So I finally went to the Library of Congress for actual archival research. They have about ten years worth of the &#8216;Kosmos&#8217; magazine from 1919-1927 that I will look at for my paper. It was really fun. The whole family went down. Jess and I both got new LoC cards, then they went to a museum and I went to read old books.</p>
<p>Up until this point my big worry had been in finding some primary documents. Now that I have them, I don&#8217;t know what to do with them. I proposed this dilemma to the class last night and they had some great ideas on how to use the source. I also have a great article to use as a template, in that the historian, Nick Hopwood, looks at the &#8216;Urania&#8217; magazine used by the socialists in Weimar Germany. (Nick Hopwood, “Producing a Socialist Popular Science in the Weimar Republic,” <span style="font-style: italic;">History Workshop Journal</span>, no. 41 (Spring 1996): 117-153.)</p>
<p>Reading this article is my goal for tonight&#8217;s short two hour study session. I&#8217;m planning on going back to the LoC on Thursday to get some more data. But here are the ideas my classmates had:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at a particular author that continually prints</li>
<li>look at one science/tech, follow how Nazi magazines and others treat  the topic</li>
<li>look at old and new to see if they deal with a subject</li>
<li>what happened to the authors of the socialist papers</li>
<li>study what kind of articles are being printed, what topics come up  continually</li>
<li>what happened to the authors/editors of the socialist papers, did  they go to Dachau, were the scientists who published put to work in  their fields?</li>
<li>narrow down the so what question. What question are you trying to  answer, that will help you know what to look for in the sources.</li>

<p>What the issue really boils down to is that I need to narrow my topic. I can&#8217;t have my topic be &#8216;science and technology in Weimar Germany&#8217;. That&#8217;s way too broad. Too broad for a dissertation, even. I like the idea of focusing on one particular science or technology, and see how it is portrayed throughout the Weimar Republic, and even into post-Weimar Germany. Ideally, it aligns with my dissertation topic of Nazi tunnels.</p>

<p>A few Nazi related items came up in the news lately.</p>
<figure id="attachment_212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" style="width: 202px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-212" title="Hitler" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png" alt="" width="202" height="103" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1.png 202w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-1-150x76.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-212" class="wp-caption-text">Never before seen photo of Hitler</figcaption></figure>
<p>From the <a title="Telegraph.co.uk" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/5451531/Unseen-Adolf-Hitler-photographs-published.html" target="_blank">Telegraph.co.uk</a> we have some never before seen photographs of Hitler. From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The colour pictures come from the collection of Hugo Jaeger, Hitler&#8217;s personal photographer, who captured him on camera him from 1936 to the final days of his rule in 1945.</p>
<p>They include a glimpse inside Berghof, his mountaintop estate in Bavaria, and his private apartments in Berlin.&#8221;</p>
<p>This will shed some more light on Hitler and life of top Nazis. It goes well with a find from a fellow PhD student at GMU who found similar photos at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum (<a title="USHMM " href="http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ssalbum/" target="_blank">http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/ssalbum/</a>). The photos are of Hitler&#8217;s apartment at Berghof, Hitler mingling with the people and at parades, and other rooms and belongings of Hitler&#8217;s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-213" title="German E-boat" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-300x107.png" alt="" width="300" height="107" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-300x107.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-250x89.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2-150x53.png 150w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-2.png 412w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-213" class="wp-caption-text">WWII German E-boat</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also <a title="German E-boat" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30977019/" target="_blank">in the news</a> is a recently uncovered German E-Boat, the S130, which interrupted an allied D-Day training and killed over 700 American servicemen. It is being reconstructed and will be used as a memorial of those who fought in World War II. From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;As owner the world&#8217;s largest privately held collection of military vehicles, Wheatcroft said he envisions the restored vessel as being a &#8220;living memorial to all sailors who died during World War Two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only example of its type left in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want it to become like something brought back from the past.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-214" title="Horton 2-29" src="http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png" alt="" width="409" height="195" srcset="https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4.png 409w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-300x143.png 300w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-250x119.png 250w, https://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Picture-4-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-214" class="wp-caption-text">Reconstructed Horton 2-29</figcaption></figure>
<p>And, finally, another World War II vessel <a title="Horton 2-29" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090625-hitlers-stealth-fighter-plane.html" target="_blank">making the news is the Horten 2-29</a>. This was a stealth jet developed by a couple of brothers. It has the uncanny resemblance to our B-2 stealth bomber. Here is <a title="Horton 2-29" href="http://resound1.com/nazi-stealth-jet-could-have-won-war-for-hitler/" target="_blank">a site</a> with a number of cool pictures. National Geographic has a cool documentary about a team of engineers at Northrop Grumman who reconstructed the airplane to test it&#8217;s stealth abilities. Most amazing of all, I think, is that the plane was made from wood! That and several layers of paint, aparently, are what make it nearly invisible to radar. I&#8217;ll have to do some research into this machine and write up a history of it.</p>
