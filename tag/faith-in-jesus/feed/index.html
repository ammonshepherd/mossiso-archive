										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More scriptures to help me get rid of evil tendencies.</p>
<p><a title="Alma 37: 29" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/alma/37/29/#29" target="_blank">Alma 37: 29</a> &#8211; Alma teaches Helaman to keep the secret plans and oaths of the devil from the people, but teach the people their wickedness so that they will abhor such wickedness.  Helaman is instructed to help the people remember the wickedness they and others have done, so that they will not want to do it themselves. So we should not focus on, or try to learn how wicked things are done, but instead focus on the consequences of wicked actions. With a knowledge of the true consequences of participating in an action, it is more likely that a wise choice will be made.</p>
<p><a title="2 Nephi 4: 31" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/2_ne/4/31/#31" target="_blank">2 Nephi 4: 31</a> &#8211; Nephi, the righteous prophet, seer of all that God has to show, asks that his soul be redeemed, that he be caused to shake at the appearance of sin.</p>
<p><a title="2 Nephi 9: 49" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/2_ne/9/49/#49" target="_blank">2 Nephi 9: 49</a> &#8211; Nephi&#8217;s soul abhors sin by praising Gd and delighting in righteousness. How do we delight in righteousness? It is what we focus on, what we are entertained by, etc.</p>
<p><a title="Alma 37: 32-33" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/37/32-33/#32" target="_blank">Alma 37: 32-33</a> &#8211; Helaman is to teach the people to hate sin and iniquity, but not to hate the people who do it. To teach them to hate sin, Helaman is to focus on teaching the people about repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, humility, meekness, and to face temptations with faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><a title="3 Nephi 20: 26" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/3_ne/20/26/#26" target="_blank">3 Nephi 20:26</a> &#8211; Christ is sent by Heavenly Father to bless us in our turning away from iniquities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul is a powerful preacher and prophet. I finished Acts and have started Romans, and I&#8217;m astounded by the works of Paul. Despite constant tribulation he keeps the faith.</p>
<p>In Romans chapter 3, he speaks to the believers and non believers in Rome. He testifies of Jesus Christ. He tells the people that it doesn&#8217;t matter if they are Jew or Gentile (non-Jew), because &#8220;is he not also [God] of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also&#8221; (<a title="Romans 3: 29" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/rom/3/29/#29" target="_blank">Romans 3: 29</a>). So God is the God of all people, not just the Jews. The acts and teachings of Jesus were for every human being, not just the Jews.</p>
<p>Why then the special situation of the Jews? Paul explains that it had been the &#8220;advantage&#8221; for the Jewish population to have &#8220;committed&#8221; unto them the oracles of God. It was to this people that God gave the prophets, the seers, the revelators. To these people were given the &#8220;advantage&#8221; to be have the mouth piece of the Lord.</p>
<p>Does this mean salvation is only for the Jews. Of course not. Salvation is available for all human beings. How does it come? Through strict obedience to the Mosaic laws? No! But through faith on Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><a title="Romans 2: 27-28" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/rom/2/27-28/#27" target="_blank">Romans 2: 27-28</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div>27  Where <em>is</em> <sup>a</sup><a title="Alma 26: 36 (10-12, 36); D&amp;C 3: 4; D&amp;C 84: 73." type="A" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/rom/3/27a">boasting</a> then?  It is excluded.  By what law?  of works?  Nay: but by the law of faith.</div>
<div>28  Therefore we conclude that a man is <sup>a</sup><a title="TG Justification." type="B" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/rom/3/28a">justified</a> by <sup>b</sup><a title="TG Faith." type="B" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/rom/3/28b">faith</a> <sup>c</sup><a title="GR apart from, without intervention of." type="P" href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/rom/3/28c">without</a> the deeds of the law.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean we only need to have faith to be saved? Yes, that&#8217;s what it means. Salvation does not depend on how well we follow the laws of Moses. Salvation depends upon how we have faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to have faith in Jesus? I&#8217;ll be looking at that through out this week.</p>
