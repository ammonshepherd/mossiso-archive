					<description><![CDATA[Hello, 
I came across this lovely memorial to your dad while looking for more information on my husband&#039;s B-17 crew.   He was the pilot of the Blue Hen Chick, your grandfather Max was the ball turret gunner.  I met your grandparents sometime in the mid eighties when they visited the Washington, D.C. area.  The courage and sacrifice of all those incredible men has been captured in a book based on the letters Ralph and his family wrote during the war.  Please see our website www.ww2pilot.com.  Your grandfather will not be forgotten.  If you will send me your street address I will be happy to send you a copy of the book, An American Family in World War II.  My husband, Reverend Ralph L. Minker Jr. passed away on Aug. 5, 2008 after a long decline with Alzheimer&#039;s disease.  
I placed a plaque to honor the crew at the Mighty Eighth Museum in Savannah, GA.  Will send you a photograph.
