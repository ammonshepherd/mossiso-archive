					<description><![CDATA[Hi Ammon,
my name is Claudio and Iâ€™m the founder of HardyPress (www.hardypress.com),

We just built a platform where you can use your WordPress as usual, but then a staticized version of the site gets published for the rest of the world to see. Something like you explained in your blog post, but automated :)

We seamlessly support Contact Form 7, and we take care of scraping your websiteâ€™s pages and augment the search box to provide instant suggestions so, for most websites, everything will work just fine, even if the site is completely static.

If you want to give a try, I would be happy to hear some feedbacks from you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mossiso.com/code/make-wordpress-static/#comment-12905&quot;&gt;john&lt;/a&gt;.

You could also run this on your local computer, if that has terminal access. This would put it on your local computer already, and have it browseable from there.

The bare minimum command you need to run is: &lt;code&gt;wget --mirror -P blog-static -nH -np -p -k -E --cut-dirs=5 http: //sitename.com/blog/&lt;/code&gt;

This should work with minor adjustments depending on what OS you run on the local computer and which flags or options that version of the wget command has.

Otherwise, there are a couple of plugins out there already: 
http://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/
http://wordpress.org/plugins/really-static/

Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi

i do not have terminal access, as my site is hosted on a shared host. any way i can do this? or, can you make it a wp plugin? 

the output i need would be browsable on my local computer, not hosted on the web. So, no need to disable comments etc. Just need the absolute minimum to make the site browsable offline. 

thx!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Ammon,

great script, I think, but I can&#039;t get it to work:
wget: --cut-dirs: Invalid number `-1&#039;.
The script has been chmodded +x and is run with root-privileges in this case.
The line-endings are unix, the shell is bash, run in an Ubuntu 12.04 x64 environment.
The SELECT-Statement in line 92 gives a correct result, which ist resolvable.
The error occurs on line 103, where 
home_cdirs=( $(echo $home_url &#124; cut -d&#039;/&#039; -f4- &#124; awk -F/ &#039;{print NF-1}&#039; ) )
is done.
I changed the cut -d&#039;/&#039; -f4- to 
cut -d&#039;/&#039; -f3- 
which makes the script work.
I think this might be caused by the  option_name = &#039;home&#039; , which is set to http://mysite.com instead of http://www.mysite.com.

Anyway, it works, and maybe someone might find my info useful.

Kind regards and thanks

Kai]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mossiso.com/code/make-wordpress-static/#comment-9730&quot;&gt;ammon&lt;/a&gt;.

Gosh, I so would like to use this script locally on my mac. I was just about to call it quits when I tried something different.
@ marco If you are running xampp like i am you should make a symlink in your root &#039;private/tmp&#039; directory
cd /private/tmp
sudo ln -s /path/to/your/xampp/or/mamp/mysql.sockfile mysql.sock
&quot;my path was /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/var/mysql/mysql.sock&quot; which i found in my my.cnf file in xampp

and like stated in directions open terminal, and cd into the root directory where your wordpress is located and run &quot;./wpstatic [optional flags]&quot;

This will get you pass this error message. However, I recieved this message later:
Run wget now? [y/n]: y
--16:07:30--  http://localhost/wordpress/
           =&#062; `wordpress-static/index.html&#039;

Connecting to localhost[127.0.0.1]:80... connected.

16:07:30 ERROR 404: Not Found.

I believe it has something to do with my local wordpress being installed in a sub directory and not the root of the htdocs. 

Any thoughts?]]></description>
