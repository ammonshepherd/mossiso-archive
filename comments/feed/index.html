					<description><![CDATA[Hi Ammon,
my name is Claudio and Iâ€™m the founder of HardyPress (www.hardypress.com),

We just built a platform where you can use your WordPress as usual, but then a staticized version of the site gets published for the rest of the world to see. Something like you explained in your blog post, but automated :)

We seamlessly support Contact Form 7, and we take care of scraping your websiteâ€™s pages and augment the search box to provide instant suggestions so, for most websites, everything will work just fine, even if the site is completely static.

If you want to give a try, I would be happy to hear some feedbacks from you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really want this to work because it loks like you put a lot of time into it and it could save me a lot of time. However, I am not getting the results I should. I have server stats working with extended on. I have links installed and netstat is working. I run ./atop and all I get is headings listed at the top &quot;Seconds  PID    CPU State TYPE         IP                  Domain/URL&quot; with the State Column Key below. There are no results shown but I have a ton of traffic right now that I am watching come through the apache logs.

Maybe it has something to do with Apache listening on 127.0.0.1 on port 8282 and Varnish caching server on port 80? I edited atop by searching and replacing localhost with &quot;admin.mysite.com&quot;. My stats are at http://admin.mystie.com/server-status and are working from any IP.

Ubuntu 16.04
Apache 2.4.18
Php 7.0
Varnish 4.1.1]]></description>
